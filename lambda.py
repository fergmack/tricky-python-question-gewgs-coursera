A function, whether named or anonymous, can be called by placing parentheses () after it.
The lambda expression had to go in parentheses just for the purposes of grouping all its contents together. 
Without the extra parentheses around it on line 10, the interpreter would group things differently and make a function of x that returns x - 2(6).
