# Below, weâ€™ve provided a for loop that sums all the elements of list1. Write code that accomplishes the same task, but instead uses a while loop. Assign the accumulator variable to the name accum.

list1 = [8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]

tot = 0
for elem in list1:
    tot = tot + elem


accum = 0 
n = 0
while n < len(list1):
    accum += list1[n]
    n += 1
