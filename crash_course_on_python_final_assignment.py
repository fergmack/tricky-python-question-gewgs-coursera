This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function.  The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary."

You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen. Save this as a .txt file somewhere on your computer.\n",

Run the following cell to perform all the installs and imports for your word cloud script and uploader widget.  It may take a minute for all of this to run and there will be a lot of output messages. But, be patient. Once you get the following final line of output, the code is done executing. Then you can continue on with the rest of the instructions for this notebook.\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In writing _Myths and Legends of Japan_ I have been much indebted to\r\n",
      "numerous authorities on Japanese subjects, and most especially to\r\n",
      "Lafcadio Hearn, who first revealed to me the Land of the Gods. It\r\n",
      "is impossible to enumerate all the writers who have assisted me in\r\n",
      "preparing this volume. I have borrowed from their work as persistently\r\n",
      "as Japan has borrowed from other countries, and I sincerely hope\r\n",
      "that, like Japan herself, I have made good use of the material I have\r\n",
      "obtained from so many sources.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am indebted to Professor Basil Hall Chamberlain for placing his work\r\n",
      "at my disposal, and I have found his encyclopædic volume, _Things\r\n",
      "Japanese_, his translation of the _Kojiki_, his _Murray's Hand-book for\r\n",
      "Japan_ (in collaboration with W. B. Mason), and his _Japanese Poetry_,\r\n",
      "of great value. I thank the Executors of the late Dr. W. G. Aston for\r\n",
      "permission to quote from this learned authority's work. I have made\r\n",
      "use of his translation of the _Nihongi_ (_Transactions of the Japan\r\n",
      "Society_, 1896) and have gathered much useful material from _A History\r\n",
      "of Japanese Literature_. I am indebted to Mr. F. Victor Dickins for\r\n",
      "allowing me to make use of his translation of the _Taketori Monogatari_\r\n",
      "and the _Ho-jō-ki_. My friend Mrs. C. M. Salwey has taken a sympathetic\r\n",
      "interest in my work, which has been invaluable to me. Her book, _Fans\r\n",
      "of Japan_, has supplied me with an exquisite legend, and many of her\r\n",
      "articles have yielded a rich harvest. I warmly thank Mr. Yone Noguchi\r\n",
      "for allowing me to quote from his poetry, and also Miss Clara A. Walsh\r\n",
      "for so kindly putting at my disposal her fascinating volume, _The\r\n",
      "Master-Singers of Japan_, published by Mr. John Murray in the \"Wisdom\r\n",
      "of the East\" series. My thanks are due to Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin\r\n",
      "Company, for allowing me to quote from Lafcadio Hearn's _Glimpses of\r\n",
      "Unfamiliar Japan_ and _The Japanese Letters of Lafcadio Hearn_; to\r\n",
      "Messrs. George Allen & Sons, for giving me permission to quote from\r\n",
      "Sir F. T. Piggott's _Garden of Japan_; to the Editor of the _Academy_,\r\n",
      "for permitting me to reprint my article on \"Japanese Poetry,\" and to\r\n",
      "Messrs. Cassell and Co. Ltd., for allowing me to reproduce \"The Garden\r\n",
      "of Japan,\" which I originally contributed to _Cassell's Magazine_. The\r\n",
      "works of Dr. William Anderson, Sir Ernest Satow, Lord Redesdale, Madame\r\n",
      "Ozaki, Mr. R. Gordon Smith, Captain F. Brinkley, the late Rev. Arthur\r\n",
      "Lloyd, Mr. Henri L. Joly, Mr. K. Okakura, the Rev. W. E. Griffis, and\r\n",
      "others, have been of immense value to me, and in addition I very warmly\r\n",
      "thank all those writers I have left unnamed, through want of space,\r\n",
      "whose works have assisted me in the preparation of this volume.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Pierre Loti in _Madame Chrysanthème_, Gilbert and Sullivan in _The\r\n",
      "Mikado_, and Sir Edwin Arnold in _Seas and Lands_, gave us the\r\n",
      "impression that Japan was a real fairyland in the Far East. We were\r\n",
      "delighted with the prettiness and quaintness of that country, and\r\n",
      "still more with the prettiness and quaintness of the Japanese people.\r\n",
      "We laughed at their topsy-turvy ways, regarded the Japanese woman, in\r\n",
      "her rich-coloured _kimono_, as altogether charming and fascinating,\r\n",
      "and had a vague notion that the principal features of Nippon were the\r\n",
      "tea-houses, cherry-blossom, and _geisha_. Twenty years ago we did not\r\n",
      "take Japan very seriously. We still listen to the melodious music of\r\n",
      "_The Mikado_, but now we no longer regard Japan as a sort of glorified\r\n",
      "willow-pattern plate. The Land of the Rising Sun has become the Land of\r\n",
      "the Risen Sun, for we have learnt that her quaintness and prettiness,\r\n",
      "her fairy-like manners and customs, were but the outer signs of a\r\n",
      "great and progressive nation. To-day we recognise Japan as a power in\r\n",
      "the East, and her victory over the Russian has made her army and navy\r\n",
      "famous throughout the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Japanese have always been an imitative nation, quick to absorb and\r\n",
      "utilise the religion, art, and social life of China, and, having set\r\n",
      "their own national seal upon what they have borrowed from the Celestial\r\n",
      "Kingdom, to look elsewhere for material that should strengthen and\r\n",
      "advance their position. This imitative quality is one of Japan's most\r\n",
      "marked characteristics. She has ever been loath to impart information\r\n",
      "to others, but ready at all times to gain access to any form of\r\n",
      "knowledge likely to make for her advancement. In the fourteenth century\r\n",
      "Kenkō wrote in his _Tsure-dzure-gusa_: \"Nothing opens one's eyes so\r\n",
      "much as travel, no matter where,\" and the twentieth-century Japanese\r\n",
      "has put this excellent advice into practice. He has travelled far and\r\n",
      "wide, and has made good use of his varied observations. Japan's power\r\n",
      "of imitation amounts to genius. East and West have contributed to her\r\n",
      "greatness, and it is a matter of surprise to many of us that a country\r\n",
      "so long isolated and for so many years bound by feudalism should,\r\n",
      "within a comparatively short space of time, master our Western system\r\n",
      "of warfare, as well as many of our ethical and social ideas, and become\r\n",
      "a great world-power. But Japan's success has not been due entirely to\r\n",
      "clever imitation, neither has her place among the foremost nations\r\n",
      "been accomplished with such meteor-like rapidity as some would have us\r\n",
      "suppose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We hear a good deal about the New Japan to-day, and are too prone to\r\n",
      "forget the significance of the Old upon which the present _régime_ has\r\n",
      "been founded. Japan learnt from England, Germany and America all the\r\n",
      "tactics of modern warfare. She established an efficient army and navy\r\n",
      "on Western lines; but it must be remembered that Japan's great heroes\r\n",
      "of to-day, Togo and Oyama, still have in their veins something of the\r\n",
      "old _samurai_ spirit, still reflect through their modernity something\r\n",
      "of the meaning of _Bushido_. The Japanese character is still Japanese\r\n",
      "and not Western. Her greatness is to be found in her patriotism, in her\r\n",
      "loyalty and whole-hearted love of her country. Shintōism has taught her\r\n",
      "to revere the mighty dead; Buddhism, besides adding to her religious\r\n",
      "ideals, has contributed to her literature and art, and Christianity has\r\n",
      "had its effect in introducing all manner of beneficent social reforms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are many conflicting theories in regard to the racial origin of\r\n",
      "the Japanese people, and we have no definite knowledge on the subject.\r\n",
      "The first inhabitants of Japan were probably the Ainu, an Aryan people\r\n",
      "who possibly came from North-Eastern Asia at a time when the distance\r\n",
      "separating the Islands from the mainland was not so great as it is\r\n",
      "to-day. The Ainu were followed by two distinct Mongol invasions, and\r\n",
      "these invaders had no difficulty in subduing their predecessors; but\r\n",
      "in course of time the Mongols were driven northward by Malays from\r\n",
      "the Philippines. \"By the year A.D. 500 the Ainu, the Mongol, and the\r\n",
      "Malay elements in the population had become one nation by much the same\r\n",
      "process as took place in England after the Norman Conquest. To the\r\n",
      "national characteristics it may be inferred that the Ainu contributed\r\n",
      "the power of resistance, the Mongol the intellectual qualities, and\r\n",
      "the Malay that handiness and adaptability which are the heritage of\r\n",
      "sailor-men.\"[1] Such authorities as Baelz and Rein are of the opinion\r\n",
      "that the Japanese are Mongols, and although they have intermarried\r\n",
      "with the Ainu, \"the two nations,\" writes Professor B. H. Chamberlain,\r\n",
      "\"are as distinct as the whites and reds in North America.\" In spite of\r\n",
      "the fact that the Ainu is looked down upon in Japan, and regarded as a\r\n",
      "hairy aboriginal of interest to the anthropologist and the showman, a\r\n",
      "poor despised creature, who worships the bear as the emblem of strength\r\n",
      "and fierceness, he has, nevertheless, left his mark upon Japan. Fuji\r\n",
      "was possibly a corruption of Huchi, or Fuchi, the Ainu Goddess of Fire,\r\n",
      "and there is no doubt that these aborigines originated a vast number\r\n",
      "of geographical names, particularly in the north of the main island,\r\n",
      "that are recognisable to this day. We can also trace Ainu influence in\r\n",
      "regard to certain Japanese superstitions, such as the belief in the\r\n",
      "_Kappa_, or river monster.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Chinese called Japan Jih-pén, \"the place the sun comes\r\n",
      "from,\" because the archipelago was situated on the east of their\r\n",
      "own kingdom, and our word Japan and Nippon are corruptions of\r\n",
      "Jih-pén. Marco Polo called the country Zipangu, and one ancient\r\n",
      "name describes it as \"The-Luxuriant-Reed-Plains-the-land-of-Fresh\r\n",
      "-Rice-Ears-of-a-Thousand-Autumns-of-Long-Five-Hundred-Autumns.\" We are\r\n",
      "not surprised to find that such a very lengthy and descriptive title\r\n",
      "is not used by the Japanese to-day; but it is of interest to know that\r\n",
      "the old word for Japan, Yamato, is still frequently employed, Yamato\r\n",
      "Damashii signifying \"The Spirit of Unconquerable Japan.\" Then, again,\r\n",
      "we still hear Japan referred to as The Island of the Dragon-fly. We are\r\n",
      "told in the old Japanese _Chronicles_ that the Emperor, in 630 B.C.,\r\n",
      "ascended a hill called Waki Kamu no Hatsuma, from which he was able to\r\n",
      "view the land on all sides. He was much impressed by the beauty of the\r\n",
      "country, and said that it resembled \"a dragon-fly licking its hinder\r\n",
      "parts,\" and the Island received the name of Akitsu-Shima (\"Island of\r\n",
      "the Dragon-fly\").\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The _Kojiki_, or \"Records of Ancient Matters,\" completed A.D. 712,\r\n",
      "deals with the early traditions of the Japanese race, commencing\r\n",
      "with the myths, the basis of Shintōism, and gradually becoming more\r\n",
      "historical until it terminates in A.D. 628. Dr. W. G. Aston writes in\r\n",
      "_A History of Japanese Literature_: \"The _Kojiki_, however valuable\r\n",
      "it may be for research into the mythology, the manners, the language,\r\n",
      "and the legends of early Japan, is a very poor production, whether we\r\n",
      "consider it as literature or as a record of facts. As history it cannot\r\n",
      "be compared with the _Nihongi_,[2] a contemporary work in Chinese;\r\n",
      "while the language is a strange mixture of Chinese and Japanese, which\r\n",
      "there has been little attempt to endue with artistic quality. The\r\n",
      "circumstances under which it was composed are a partial explanation of\r\n",
      "the very curious style in which it is written. We are told that a man\r\n",
      "named Yasumaro, learned in Chinese, took it down from the lips of a\r\n",
      "certain Hiyeda no Are, who had such a wonderful memory that he 'could\r\n",
      "repeat with his mouth whatever was placed before his eyes, and record\r\n",
      "in his heart whatever struck his ears.'\" It is possible that Hiyeda no\r\n",
      "Are was one of the Kataribe or \"Reciters,\" whose duty it was to recite\r\n",
      "\"ancient words\" before the Mikado at the Court of Nara on certain State\r\n",
      "occasions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The _Kojiki_ and the _Nihongi_ are the sources from which we learn the\r\n",
      "early myths and legends of Japan. In their pages we are introduced\r\n",
      "to Izanagi and Izanami, Ama-terasu, Susa-no-o, and numerous other\r\n",
      "divinities, and these august beings provide us with stories that are\r\n",
      "quaint, beautiful, quasi-humorous, and sometimes a little horrible.\r\n",
      "What could be more naïve than the love-making of Izanagi and Izanami,\r\n",
      "who conceived the idea of marrying each other after seeing the mating\r\n",
      "of two wagtails? In this ancient myth we trace the ascendency of the\r\n",
      "male over the female, an ascendency maintained in Japan until recent\r\n",
      "times, fostered, no doubt, by Kaibara's _Onna Daigaku_, \"The Greater\r\n",
      "Learning for Women.\" But in the protracted quarrel between the Sun\r\n",
      "Goddess and her brother, the Impetuous Male, the old chroniclers lay\r\n",
      "emphasis upon the villainy of Susa-no-o; and Ama-terasu, a curious\r\n",
      "mingling of the divine and the feminine, is portrayed as an ideal\r\n",

      "us of other cosmogony stories. The _In_ and _Yo_, corresponding to\r\n",

      "It was more convenient for the old Japanese writers to imagine the\r\n",

      "a prominent, and after all very rational, place. We are told in the\r\n",
      "_Nihongi_ that these male and female principles \"formed a chaotic\r\n",
      "mass like an egg which was of obscurely defined limits and contained\r\n",
      "germs.\" Eventually this egg was quickened into life, and the purer and\r\n",
      "clearer part was drawn out and formed Heaven, while the heavier element\r\n",
      "settled down and became Earth, which was \"compared to the floating\r\n",
      "of a fish sporting on the surface of the water.\" A mysterious form\r\n",
      "resembling a reed-shoot suddenly appeared between Heaven and Earth,\r\n",
      "and as suddenly became transformed into a God called Kuni-toko-tachi,\r\n",
      "(\"Land-eternal-stand-of-august-thing\"). We may pass over the other\r\n",
      "divine births until we come to the important deities known as Izanagi\r\n",
      "and Izanami (\"Male-who-invites\" and \"Female-who-invites\"). About these\r\n",
      "beings has been woven an entrancing myth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Izanagi and Izanami\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Izanagi and Izanami stood on the Floating Bridge of Heaven and\r\n",
      "looked down into the abyss. They inquired of each other if there\r\n",
      "were a country far, far below the great Floating Bridge. They\r\n",
      "were determined to find out. In order to do so they thrust down a\r\n",
      "jewel-spear, and found the ocean. Raising the spear a little, water\r\n",
      "dripped from it, coagulated, and became the island of Onogoro-jima\r\n",
      "(\"Spontaneously-congeal-island\").\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon this island the two deities descended. Shortly afterwards they\r\n",
      "desired to become husband and wife, though as a matter of fact they\r\n",
      "were brother and sister; but such a relationship in the East has never\r\n",
      "precluded marriage. These deities accordingly set up a pillar on the\r\n",
      "island. Izanagi walked round one way, and Izanami the other. When they\r\n",
      "met, Izanami said: \"How delightful! I have met with a lovely youth.\"\r\n",
      "One would have thought that this naïve remark would have pleased\r\n",
      "Izanagi; but it made him, extremely angry, and he retorted: \"I am a\r\n",
      "man, and by that right should have spoken first. How is it that on the\r\n",
      "contrary thou, a woman, shouldst have been the first to speak? This is\r\n",
      "unlucky. Let us go round again.\" So it happened that the two deities\r\n",
      "started afresh. Once again they met, and this time Izanagi remarked:\r\n",
      "\"How delightful! I have met a lovely maiden.\" Shortly after this very\r\n",
      "ingenuous proposal Izanagi and Izanami were married.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Izanami had given birth to islands, seas, rivers, herbs, and\r\n",
      "trees, she and her lord consulted together, saying: \"We have now\r\n",
      "produced the Great-Eight-Island country, with the mountains, rivers,\r\n",
      "herbs, and trees. Why should we not produce some one who shall be the\r\n",
      "Lord of the Universe?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wish of these deities was fulfilled, for in due season\r\n",
      "Ama-terasu, the Sun Goddess, was born. She was known as\r\n",
      "\"Heaven-Illumine-of-Great-Deity,\" and was so extremely beautiful that\r\n",
      "her parents determined to send her up the Ladder of Heaven, and in the\r\n",
      "high sky above to cast for ever her glorious sunshine upon the earth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their next child was the Moon God, Tsuki-yumi. His silver radiance was\r\n",
      "not so fair as the golden effulgence of his sister, the Sun Goddess,\r\n",
      "but he was, nevertheless, deemed worthy to be her consort. So up the\r\n",
      "Ladder of Heaven climbed the Moon God. They soon quarrelled, and\r\n",
      "Ama-terasu said: \"Thou art a wicked deity. I must not see thee face\r\n",
      "to face.\" They were therefore separated by a day and night, and dwelt\r\n",
      "apart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next child of Izanagi and Izanami was Susa-no-o (\"The Impetuous\r\n",

      "content ourselves for the present with confining our attention to his\r\n",
      "parents.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Izanami gave birth to the Fire God, Kagu-tsuchi. The birth of this\r\n",
      "child made her extremely ill. Izanagi knelt on the ground, bitterly\r\n",
      "weeping and lamenting. But his sorrow availed nothing, and Izanami\r\n",
      "crept away into the Land of Yomi (Hades).\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her lord, however, could not live without her, and he too went into the\r\n",
      "Land of Yomi. When he discovered her, she said regretfully: \"My lord\r\n",
      "and husband, why is thy coming so late? I have already eaten of the\r\n",
      "cooking-furnace of Yomi. Nevertheless, I am about to lie down to rest.\r\n",

      "off a piece, and lighted it. The sight that greeted him was ghastly\r\n",
      "and horrible in the extreme. His once beautiful wife had now become a\r\n",
      "swollen and festering creature. Eight varieties of Thunder Gods rested\r\n",
      "upon her. The Thunder of the Fire, Earth, and Mountain were all there\r\n",
      "leering upon him, and roaring with their great voices.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Izanagi grew frightened and disgusted, saying: \"I have come unawares to\r\n",
      "a hideous and polluted land.\" His wife retorted: \"Why didst thou not\r\n",
      "observe that which I charged thee? Now am I put to shame.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Izanami was so angry with her lord for ignoring her wish and breaking\r\n",
      "in upon her privacy that she sent the Eight Ugly Females of Yomi to\r\n",
      "pursue him. Izanagi drew his sword and fled down the dark regions of\r\n",
      "the Underworld. As he ran he took off his headdress, and flung it to\r\n",
      "the ground. It immediately became a bunch of grapes. When the Ugly\r\n",
      "Females saw it, they bent down and ate the luscious fruit. Izanami saw\r\n",
      "them pause, and deemed it wise to pursue her lord herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time Izanagi had reached the Even Pass of Yomi. Here he placed\r\n",
      "a huge rock, and eventually came face to face with Izanami. One would\r\n",
      "scarcely have thought that amid such exciting adventures Izanagi\r\n",
      "would have solemnly declared a divorce. But this is just what he did\r\n",
      "do. To this proposal his wife replied: \"My dear lord and husband, if\r\n",
      "thou sayest so, I will strangle to death the people in one day.\" This\r\n",
      "plaintive and threatening speech in no way influenced Izanagi, who\r\n",
      "readily replied that he would cause to be born in one day no less than\r\n",
      "fifteen hundred.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The above remark must have proved conclusive, for when we next hear\r\n",
      "of Izanagi he had escaped from the Land of Yomi, from an angry wife,\r\n",
      "and from the Eight Ugly Females. After his escape he was engaged in\r\n",
      "copious ablutions, by way of purification, from which numerous deities\r\n",
      "were born. We read in the _Nihongi_: \"After this, Izanagi, his divine\r\n",
      "task having been accomplished, and his spirit-career about to suffer a\r\n",
      "change, built himself an abode of gloom in the island of Ahaji, where\r\n",
      "he dwelt for ever in silence and concealment.\"\r\n",

      "Ama-terasu and Susa-no-o\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Susa-no-o, or \"The Impetuous Male,\" was the brother of Ama-terasu, the\r\n",
      "Sun Goddess. Now Susa-no-o was a very undesirable deity indeed, and he\r\n",
      "figured in the Realm of the Japanese Gods as a decidedly disturbing\r\n",
      "element. His character has been clearly drawn in the _Nihongi_, more\r\n",
      "clearly perhaps than that of any other deity mentioned in these ancient\r\n",
      "records. Susa-no-o had a very bad temper, which often resulted in many\r\n",
      "cruel and ungenerous acts. Moreover, in spite of his long beard, he had\r\n",
      "a habit of continually weeping and wailing. Where a child in a tantrum\r\n",
      "would crush a toy to pieces, the Impetuous Male, when in a towering\r\n",
      "rage, and without a moment's warning, would wither the once fair\r\n",
      "greenery of mountains, and in addition bring many people to an untimely\r\n",
      "end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His parents, Izanagi and Izanami, were much troubled by his doings,\r\n",
      "and, after consulting together, they decided to banish their unruly son\r\n",
      "to the Land of Yomi. Susa, however, had a word to say in the matter. He\r\n",
      "made the following petition, saying: \"I will now obey thy instructions\r\n",
      "and proceed to the Nether-Land (Yomi). Therefore I wish for a short\r\n",
      "time to go to the Plain of High Heaven and meet with my elder sister\r\n",
      "(Ama-terasu), after which I will go away for ever.\" This apparently\r\n",
      "harmless request was granted, and Susa-no-o ascended to Heaven. His\r\n",
      "departure occasioned a great commotion of the sea, and the hills and\r\n",
      "mountains groaned aloud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now Ama-terasu heard these noises, and perceiving that they denoted the\r\n",
      "near approach of her wicked brother Susa-no-o, she said to herself:\r\n",
      "\"Is my younger brother coming with good intentions? I think it must be\r\n",
      "his purpose to rob me of my kingdom. By the charge which our parents\r\n",
      "gave to their children, each of us has his own allotted limits. Why,\r\n",

      "make bold to come spying here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "heard proceeding from the roof of the palace, called the Purple Hall of\r\n",

      "that a dark cloud crept from the eastern horizon, and alighted on the\r\n",
      "roof of the august palace. Those who waited in the imperial bed-chamber\r\n",
      "heard extraordinary scratching sounds, as if what had at first appeared\r\n",
      "to be a cloud had suddenly changed into a beast with gigantic and\r\n",
      "powerful claws.\r\n",

      "At last it was decided that Yorimasa was the one knight in the kingdom\r\n",
      "valiant enough to relieve his Majesty of these terrible hauntings.\r\n",
      "Yorimasa accordingly made elaborate preparations for the fray. He took\r\n",
      "his best bow and steel-headed arrows, donned his armour, over which he\r\n",
      "wore a hunting-dress, and a ceremonial cap instead of his usual helmet.\r\n",

      "At sunset he lay in concealment outside the palace. While he thus\r\n",
      "waited thunder crashed overhead, lightning blazed in the sky, and the\r\n",
      "wind shrieked like a pack of wild demons. But Yorimasa was a brave\r\n",
      "man, and the fury of the elements in no way daunted him. When midnight\r\n",
      "came he saw a black cloud rush through the sky and rest upon the\r\n",
      "roof of the palace. At the north-east corner it stopped. Once more the\r\n",
      "lightning flashed in the sky, and this time he saw the gleaming eyes of\r\n",
      "a large animal. Noting the exact position of this strange monster, he\r\n",
      "pulled at his bow till it became as round as the full moon. In another\r\n",
      "moment his steel-headed arrow hit its mark. There was an awful roar of\r\n",

      "Yorimasa and his retainer ran forward and despatched the fearful\r\n",

      "It was no wonder that the Emperor gave orders that the skin of this\r\n",
      "monster should be kept for all time as a curiosity in the Imperial\r\n",

      "Benkei with \"Little John, Will Scarlet, and Friar Tuck rolled in\r\n",
      "one.\" Yoshitsune would have seemed a very remarkable hero had not\r\n",
      "his faithful henchman, Benkei, also figured in Japanese history and\r\n",
      "legend. As it is we are forced to admit that Benkei was far and away\r\n",
      "the greater man. He not only towered in stature above his companions,\r\n",
      "but he rose above his brethren in courage, wit, resource, and a\r\n",
      "wonderful tenderness. Here was a man who could slay a hundred men with\r\n",
      "absolute ease, and with the same quiet assurance expound the Buddhist\r\n",
      "Scriptures. He could weep over Yoshitsune when, by way of strategy, he\r\n",
      "found it necessary to severely beat him, and with infinite gentleness\r\n",
      "render assistance when his lord's wife gave birth to a son. There\r\n",
      "was yet another side to Benkei's versatile character--his love of a\r\n",
      "practical joke. The bell incident, referred to elsewhere, is a case in\r\n",
      "point, and his enormous feast at the expense of a number of priests\r\n",
      "another; but if he had his joke he never failed to pay for the laugh to\r\n",
      "the full. Benkei remarked on one occasion: \"When there is an unlucky\r\n",
      "lot to draw my lord sees to it that I am the one to get it.\" This was\r\n",
      "certainly true. Benkei always made a point of doing the dirty work, and\r\n",
      "when his master asked him to do anything Benkei's only complaint was\r\n",
      "that the task was not sufficiently difficult, though as a matter of\r\n",

      "Jin-saku's anvil that useful object sank deep into the earth, and for\r\n",
      "firewood he would bring a great pine-tree. When Benkei was seventeen\r\n",
      "years old he became a priest in a Buddhist temple; but that did not\r\n",
      "prevent him from having a thrilling escapade with a beautiful young\r\n",
      "girl called Tamamushi. We soon find our hero breaking away from love\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Yoshitsune's father, Yoshitomo, had been killed in a great battle with\r\n",
      "the Taira. At that time the Taira clan was all-powerful, and its cruel\r\n",
      "leader, Kiyomori, did all he could to destroy Yoshitomo's children.\r\n",
      "But the mother of these children, Tokiwa, fled into hiding, taking\r\n",
      "her little ones with her. With characteristic Japanese fortitude, she\r\n",
      "finally consented to become the wife of the hated Kiyomori. She did so\r\n",
      "because it was the only way to save the lives of her children. She was\r\n",

      "\"Remember thy father, Minamoto Yoshitomo! Grow strong and avenge his\r\n",
      "death, for he died at the hands of the Taira!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "boy ever treasured in his heart the dauntless words of his brave,\r\n",
      "self-sacrificing mother. They stirred and quickened him to action. He\r\n",
      "used to go to a certain valley, where he would flourish his little\r\n",
      "wooden sword, and, singing fragments of war-songs, hit out at rocks\r\n",
      "and stones, desiring that he might one day become a great warrior, and\r\n",
      "right the wrongs so heavily heaped upon his family by the Taira clan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night, while thus engaged, he was startled by a great thunderstorm,\r\n",
      "and saw before him a mighty giant with a long red nose and enormous\r\n",
      "glaring eyes, bird-like claws, and feathered wings. Bravely standing\r\n",
      "his ground, Yoshitsune inquired who this giant might be, and was\r\n",
      "informed that he was King of the Tengu--that is, King of the elves of\r\n",
      "the mountains, sprightly little beings who were frequently engaged in\r\n",
      "all manner of fantastic tricks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The King of the Tengu was very kindly disposed towards Yoshitsune. He\r\n",
      "explained that he admired his perseverance, and told him that he had\r\n",
      "appeared upon the scene with the meritorious intention of teaching him\r\n",
      "all that was to be learnt in the art of swordsmanship. The lessons\r\n",
      "progressed in a most satisfactory manner, and it was not long before\r\n",
      "Yoshitsune could vanquish as many as twenty small _tengu_, and this\r\n",

      "later on in the story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now when Yoshitsune was fifteen years old he heard that there lived on\r\n",
      "Mount Hiei a very wild _bonze_ (priest) by the name of Benkei. Benkei\r\n",
      "had for some time waylaid knights who happened to cross the Gojo Bridge\r\n",
      "of Kyōto. His idea was to obtain a thousand swords, and he was so\r\n",
      "brave, although such a rascal, that he had won from knights no less\r\n",
      "than nine hundred and ninety-nine swords by his lawless behaviour. When\r\n",
      "the news of these doings reached the ears of Yoshitsune he determined\r\n",
      "to put the teaching of the King of the Tengu to good use and slay this\r\n",
      "Benkei, and so put an end to one who had become a terror in the land.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening Yoshitsune started out, and, in order to establish the\r\n",
      "manner and bearing of absolute indifference, he played upon his flute\r\n",
      "till he came to the Gojo Bridge. Presently he saw coming towards him\r\n",
      "a gigantic man clad in black armour, who was none other than Benkei.\r\n",
      "When Benkei saw the youth he considered it to be beneath his dignity\r\n",
      "to attack what appeared to him to be a mere weakling, a dreamer who\r\n",
      "could play excellently, and no doubt write a pretty poem about the\r\n",
      "moon, which was then shining in the sky, but one who was in no way a\r\n",
      "warrior. This affront naturally angered Yoshitsune, and he suddenly\r\n",

      "and from the rear to the front again, mocking the giant with many a\r\n",

      "great storm arose. Mysterious noises came from the towering waves, a\r\n",
      "far-away echo of the din of battle, of the rushing of ships and the\r\n",
      "whirling of arrows, of the footfall of a thousand men. Louder and\r\n",
      "louder the noise grew, and from the lashing crests of the waves there\r\n",

      "and daughters. These young men and women he took back to his mountain\r\n",
      "stronghold, and, sad to narrate, after making sport of them, he and\r\n",
      "his goblin companions made a great feast and devoured these poor\r\n",
      "young people. Even the sacred Court was not exempt from these awful\r\n",

      "finally to slay the King of the Goblins. He explained that subtlety\r\n",
      "of action was most essential if they wished for success in their\r\n",
      "enterprise, and that it would be well to go disguised as mountain\r\n",
      "priests, and to carry their armour and weapons on their backs,\r\n",
      "carefully concealed in unsuspicious-looking knapsacks. Before starting\r\n",

      "utmost friendliness and thankfulness. These old men were none other\r\n",
      "than the deities to whom the knights had prayed before setting out\r\n",

      "_saké_ called Shimben-Kidoku-Shu (\"a cordial for men, but poison for\r\n",
      "goblins\"), advising him that he should by strategy get Shutendoji to\r\n",

      "an easy victim for the final despatch. No sooner had these old men\r\n",

      "led the little band to a great palace of black iron, satisfying the\r\n",

      "the largest she had ever seen, and as this old woman and her husband\r\n",
      "were extremely poor she immediately thought what an excellent meal this\r\n",
      "extraordinary peach would make. As she could find no stick with which\r\n",
      "to draw the fruit to the bank, she suddenly remembered the following\r\n",

      "possible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When her husband arrived in the evening, with a bundle of grass upon\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "devils surrender.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The pheasant flew over the sea and alighted on the roof of a great\r\n",

      "sign of submission, should break their horns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The devils only laughed and shook their horns and shaggy red hair. Then\r\n",
      "they brought forth iron bars and hurled them furiously at the bird. The\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In the meantime Momotaro had landed with his two companions. He had no\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "dragon-shaped crown resting upon his red hair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am the Dragon King of Lake Biwa,\" explained the red-haired man. \"A\r\n",

      "a mortal who would not be afraid of me. You, my lord, showed no fear,\r\n",
      "and I rejoice exceedingly. A great centipede comes down from yonder\r\n",
      "mountain, enters my palace, and destroys my children and grandchildren.\r\n",
      "One by one they have become food for this dread creature, and I fear\r\n",
      "soon that unless something can be done to slay this centipede I myself\r\n",
      "shall become a victim. I have waited long for a brave mortal. All men\r\n",
      "who have hitherto seen me in my dragon-shape have run away. You are a\r\n",
      "brave man, and I beg that you will kill my bitter enemy.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hidesato, who always welcomed an adventure, the more so when it was a\r\n",

      "King.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Hidesato reached the Dragon King's palace he found it to be a\r\n",
      "very magnificent building indeed, scarcely less beautiful than the\r\n",
      "Sea King's palace itself. He was feasted with crystallised lotus\r\n",
      "leaves and flowers, and ate the delicacies spread before him with\r\n",
      "choice ebony chopsticks. While he feasted ten little goldfish danced,\r\n",
      "and just behind the goldfish ten carp made sweet music on the _koto_\r\n",
      "and _samisen_. Hidesato was just thinking how excellently he had been\r\n",
      "entertained, and how particularly good was the wine, when they all\r\n",
      "heard an awful noise like a dozen thunderclaps roaring together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hidesato and the Dragon King hastily rose and ran to the balcony. They\r\n",
      "saw that Mount Mikami was scarcely recognisable, for it was covered\r\n",
      "from top to bottom with the great coils of the centipede. In its head\r\n",
      "glowed two balls of fire, and its hundred feet were like a long winding\r\n",
      "chain of lanterns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hidesato fitted an arrow to his bowstring and pulled it back with all\r\n",
      "his might. The arrow sped forth into the night and struck the centipede\r\n",
      "in the middle of the head, but glanced off immediately without\r\n",
      "inflicting any wound. Again Hidesato sent an arrow whirling into the\r\n",
      "air, and again it struck the monster and fell harmlessly to the ground.\r\n",
      "Hidesato had only one arrow left. Suddenly remembering the magical\r\n",
      "effect of human saliva, he put the remaining arrow-head into his mouth\r\n",
      "for a moment, and then hastily adjusted it to his bow and took careful\r\n",
      "aim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last arrow struck its mark and pierced the centipede's brain. The\r\n",
      "creature stopped moving; the light in its eyes and legs darkened and\r\n",
      "then went out, and Lake Biwa, with its palace beneath, was shrouded in\r\n",
      "awful darkness. Thunder rolled, lightning flashed, and it seemed for\r\n",
      "the moment that the Dragon King's palace would topple to the ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day, however, all sign of storm had vanished. The sky was\r\n",
      "clear. The sun shone brightly. In the sparkling blue lake lay the body\r\n",
      "of the great centipede.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dragon King and those about him were overjoyed when they knew that\r\n",
      "their dread enemy had been destroyed. Hidesato was again feasted, even\r\n",
      "more royally than before. When he finally departed he did so with a\r\n",
      "retinue of fishes suddenly converted into men. The Dragon King bestowed\r\n",
      "upon our hero five precious gifts--two bells, a bag of rice, a roll of\r\n",
      "silk, and a cooking-pot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dragon King accompanied Hidesato as far as the bridge, and then he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When Hidesato reached his home the Dragon King's servants put down the\r\n",
      "presents and suddenly disappeared.\r\n",

      "The presents were no ordinary gifts. The rice-bag was inexhaustible,\r\n",
      "there was no end to the roll of silk, and the cooking-pot would\r\n",
      "cook without fire of any kind. Only the bells were without magical\r\n",
      "properties, and these were presented to a temple in the vicinity.\r\n",

      "Long ago there lived an old bamboo-cutter by the name of Sanugi no\r\n",
      "Miyakko. One day, while he was busy with his hatchet in a grove of\r\n",
      "bamboos, he suddenly perceived a miraculous light, and on closer\r\n",
      "inspection discovered in the heart of a reed a very small creature of\r\n",
      "exquisite beauty. He gently picked up the tiny girl, only about four\r\n",
      "inches in height, and carried her home to his wife. So delicate was\r\n",
      "this little maiden that she had to be reared in a basket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now it happened that the Bamboo-cutter continued to set about his\r\n",
      "business, and night and day, as he cut down the reeds, he found gold,\r\n",
      "and, once poor, he now amassed a considerable fortune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The child, after she had been but three months with these simple\r\n",
      "country folk, suddenly grew in stature to that of a full-grown maid;\r\n",
      "and in order that she should be in keeping with such a pleasing,\r\n",
      "if surprising, event, her hair, hitherto allowed to flow in long\r\n",
      "tresses about her shoulders, was now fastened in a knot on her head.\r\n",
      "In due season the Bamboo-cutter named the girl the Lady Kaguya, or\r\n",
      "\"Precious-Slender-Bamboo-of-the-Field-of-Autumn.\" When she had been\r\n",
      "named a great feast was held, in which all the neighbours participated.\r\n",

      "Now the Lady Kaguya was of all women the most beautiful, and\r\n",
      "immediately after the feast the fame of her beauty spread throughout\r\n",
      "the land. Would-be lovers gathered around the fence and lingered in\r\n",
      "the porch with the hope of at least getting a glimpse of this lovely\r\n",
      "maiden. Night and day these forlorn suitors waited, but in vain. Those\r\n",
      "who were of humble origin gradually began to recognise that their\r\n",
      "love-making was useless. But five wealthy suitors still persisted, and\r\n",
      "would not relax their efforts. They were Prince Ishizukuri and Prince\r\n",
      "Kuramochi, the Sadaijin Dainagon Abe no Miushi, the Chiunagon Otomo no\r\n",
      "Miyuki, and Morotada, the Lord of Iso. These ardent lovers bore \"the\r\n",
      "ice and snow of winter and the thunderous heats of midsummer with equal\r\n",
      "fortitude.\" When these lords finally asked the Bamboo-cutter to bestow\r\n",
      "his daughter upon one of them, the old man politely explained that the\r\n",
      "maiden was not really his daughter, and as that was so she could not be\r\n",
      "compelled to obey his own wishes in the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the lords returned to their mansions, but still continued\r\n",
      "to make their supplications more persistently than ever. Even the\r\n",
      "kindly Bamboo-cutter began to remonstrate with the Lady Kaguya, and to\r\n",
      "point out that it was becoming for so handsome a maid to marry, and\r\n",
      "that among the five noble suitors she could surely make a very good\r\n",
      "match. To this the wise Kaguya replied: \"Not so fair am I that I may\r\n",
      "be certain of a man's faith, and were I to mate with one whose heart\r\n",
      "proved fickle what a miserable fate were mine! Noble lords, without\r\n",
      "doubt, are these of whom thou speakest, but I would not wed a man whose\r\n",
      "heart should be all untried and unknown.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was finally arranged that Kaguya should marry the suitor who proved\r\n",
      "himself the most worthy. This news brought momentary hope to the five\r\n",
      "great lords, and when night came they assembled before the house where\r\n",
      "the maiden dwelt \"with flute music and with singing, with chanting to\r\n",
      "accompaniments and piping, with cadenced tap and clap of fan.\" Only the\r\n",
      "Bamboo-cutter went out to thank the lords for their serenading. When he\r\n",

      "The old Bamboo-cutter naturally thought that with such a guard to\r\n",
      "protect his daughter the invasion from the moon would prove utterly\r\n",
      "futile. The Lady Kaguya attempted to correct the old man's ideas on the\r\n",
      "subject, saying: \"Ye cannot prevail over the folk of yonder land, nor\r\n",
      "will your artillery harm them nor your defences avail against them,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The following legend is obviously not of Japanese origin. The priests\r\n",
      "of Buddhism in Japan knew that the success of their religion lay, not\r\n",
      "in sweeping out the old gods of Shintō, but in adapting them with\r\n",
      "infinite cleverness to the needs of their own teaching. In this case\r\n",
      "Japan has borrowed from India and in a minor degree from China, if\r\n",
      "we may look upon the dragon as originally belonging to the Celestial\r\n",
      "Kingdom. We have followed closely Mr. Edward Greey's version, and\r\n",
      "insert it here because it often enters into a Nippon priest's\r\n",
      "discourse, and has a decidedly Japanese setting. We might duplicate\r\n",
      "legends of this kind, but one will be sufficient for our purpose. The\r\n",
      "other two legends given in this chapter are strictly Japanese.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Lord Buddha, having concluded his holy meditations upon Mount\r\n",
      "Dan-doku, slowly walked along a rocky pathway on his way to the city.\r\n",
      "The dark shadows of night crept over the country, and there was\r\n",
      "profound stillness everywhere.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On nearing his destination the Lord Buddha heard some one shout:\r\n",
      "\"_Shio-giyo mu-jiyo_!\" (\"The outward manner is not always an index to\r\n",
      "the natural disposition.\")\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Lord Buddha was delighted at these words, and desired to learn who\r\n",
      "had spoken so wisely. Over and over again he heard the same words, and,\r\n",
      "drawing to the edge of a precipice, he looked down into the valley\r\n",
      "beneath, and perceived an extremely ugly dragon gazing up at him with\r\n",

      "The Holy One then seated himself upon a rock, and inquired of the\r\n",
      "dragon how he had come to learn one of the highest mysteries of\r\n",
      "Buddhism. Such profound wisdom suggested a store of spiritual truths\r\n",
      "yet to be revealed, and the Lord Buddha, therefore, requested that the\r\n",
      "dragon should give utterance to other wise sayings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the dragon, having coiled himself round the rock, shouted with a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At this the Holy One remarked that he would deny the dragon nothing so\r\n",
      "long as he heard the fourth truth revealed, and inquired of the dragon\r\n",

      "wisdom, the Master informed the dragon that his religion forbade the\r\n",

      "and as for its thumbs they are three feet round. It is probably the\r\n",
      "tallest piece of bronze in the world. Such an enormous image naturally\r\n",
      "created a considerable sensation in the days when Kamakura was a\r\n",
      "flourishing city, laid out by the great General Yoritomo. The roads in\r\n",

      "whale, who lived in the Northern Sea, happened to hear about the Bronze\r\n",
      "Buddha of Kamakura, and as he regarded himself as being far bigger\r\n",
      "than anything on land, the idea of a possible rival did not meet with\r\n",
      "his approval. He deemed it impossible that little men could construct\r\n",

      "the very absurdity of such a conception.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His laughter, however, did not last long. He was inordinately jealous,\r\n",

      "incessant praise evoked from those who had seen the image he grew\r\n",
      "exceedingly angry, lashed the sea into foam, and blew down his nose\r\n",
      "with so much violence that the other creatures of the deep gave him a\r\n",
      "very wide berth. His loneliness only aggravated his trouble, and he\r\n",
      "was unable to eat or sleep, and in consequence grew thin. He at last\r\n",
      "decided to chat the matter over with a kindly shark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shark answered the whale's heated questions with quiet solicitude,\r\n",

      "measurement of the image, and bring back the result of his labour to\r\n",
      "his agitated friend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shark set off upon his journey, until he came to the shore, where\r\n",
      "he could see the image towering above him, about half a mile inland.\r\n",

      "when he had the good fortune to discover a rat enjoying a scamper\r\n",
      "along a junk. He explained his mission to the rat, and requested that\r\n",
      "much-flattered little creature to take the measurement of the Bronze\r\n",
      "Buddha.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So the rat climbed down the junk, swam ashore, and entered the dark\r\n",
      "temple where the Great Buddha stood. At first he was so overcome by\r\n",
      "the magnificence he saw about him that he was uncertain as to how to\r\n",
      "proceed in carrying out the shark's request. He eventually decided to\r\n",
      "walk round the image, counting his footsteps as he went. He discovered\r\n",
      "after he had performed this task that he had walked exactly five\r\n",
      "thousand paces, and on his return to the junk he told the shark the\r\n",
      "measurement of the base of the Bronze Buddha.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shark, with profuse thanks to the rat, returned to the Northern\r\n",

      "this exasperating image were only too true.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing\" evidently applies equally\r\n",
      "well to whales, for the whale of this legend, after receiving the\r\n",
      "information, grew more furious than ever. As in a story familiar to\r\n",
      "English children, he put on magic boots in order to travel on land as\r\n",
      "well as he had always done in the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The whale reached the Kamakura temple at night. He discovered that the\r\n",
      "priests had gone to bed, and were apparently fast asleep. He knocked at\r\n",
      "the door. Instead of the dismal murmur of a half-awake priest he heard\r\n",
      "the Lord Buddha say, in a voice that rang like the sound of a great\r\n",
      "bell: \"Come in!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I cannot,\" replied the whale, \"because I am too big. Will you please\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When Buddha found out who his visitor was, and what he wanted at so\r\n",
      "unearthly an hour, he condescendingly stepped down from his pedestal\r\n",
      "and came outside the temple. There was utter amazement on both sides.\r\n",
      "Had the whale possessed knees they would assuredly have knocked\r\n",
      "together. He knocked his head on the ground instead. For his part,\r\n",
      "Buddha was surprised to find a creature of such gigantic proportions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We can imagine the consternation of the chief priest when he found that\r\n",
      "the pedestal did not bear the image of his Master. Hearing a strange\r\n",
      "conversation going on outside the temple, he went out to see what was\r\n",
      "taking place. The much-frightened priest was invited to join in the\r\n",
      "discussion, and was requested to take the measurement of the image and\r\n",
      "the whale, and accordingly began to measure with his rosary. During\r\n",
      "this proceeding the image and the whale awaited the result with bated\r\n",
      "breath. When the measurements had been taken the whale was found to be\r\n",
      "two inches longer and taller than the image.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The whale went back to the Northern Sea more utterly vain than ever,\r\n",
      "while the image returned to its temple and sat down again, and there it\r\n",
      "has remained to this day, none the worse, perhaps, for finding that it\r\n",
      "was not quite so big as it imagined. Dealers in dry goods and dealers\r\n",
      "in wood and iron agreed from that day to this to differ as to what was\r\n",

      "frailty she spoke with conviction. Her mother-heart seemed to lend her\r\n",

      "great and gorgeous building of coral, relieved here and there with\r\n",
      "clusters of many-coloured seaweed. The palace was like a huge pagoda,\r\n",
      "rising tier upon tier. The woman swam nearer in order to inspect it\r\n",
      "more closely, and she perceived a bright light, more brilliant than the\r\n",
      "light of many moons, so bright that it dazzled her eyes. It was the\r\n",
      "light of Buddha's Crystal, placed on the pinnacle of this vast abode,\r\n",

      "asleep, appearing to watch even in their slumber!\r\n",

      "No sooner had she snatched the Crystal from its resting-place than the\r\n",
      "guardians awoke; their great claws extended and their tails furiously\r\n",
      "lashed the water, and in another moment they were in hot pursuit.\r\n",
      "Rather than lose the Crystal, which she had won at so much peril, the\r\n",
      "woman cut a wound in her left breast and forced the jewel into the\r\n",
      "bleeding cavity, pressing her hand, without a murmur of pain, upon the\r\n",
      "poor torn flesh. When the dragons perceived that the water was murky\r\n",

      "the rocks far above, drew her to land with ever-quickening speed. They\r\n",
      "gently laid her upon the shore, and found that her eyes were closed\r\n",
      "and her breast bleeding profusely. Kamatari at first thought that the\r\n",
      "woman had risked her life in vain; but bending over her he noticed the\r\n",
      "wound in her breast. At that moment she opened her eyes, and, taking\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Inari, the Fox God\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fox takes an important place in Japanese legend, and the subject\r\n",
      "is of a far-reaching and complex kind.[1] Inari was originally the\r\n",
      "God of Rice, but in the eleventh century he became associated with\r\n",
      "the Fox God, with attributes for good and evil, mostly for evil, so\r\n",
      "profuse and so manifold in their application that they cause no little\r\n",
      "confusion to the English reader. All foxes possess supernatural powers\r\n",
      "to an almost limitless degree. They have the power of infinite vision;\r\n",
      "they can hear everything and understand the secret thoughts of mankind\r\n",
      "generally, and in addition they possess the power of transformation and\r\n",
      "of transmutation. The chief attribute of the bad fox is the power to\r\n",
      "delude human beings, and for this purpose it will take the form of a\r\n",
      "beautiful woman, and many are the legends told in this connection.[2]\r\n",
      "If the shadow of a fox-woman chance to fall upon water, only the fox,\r\n",
      "and not the fair woman, is revealed. It is said that if a dog sees a\r\n",
      "fox-woman the feminine form vanishes immediately, and the fox alone\r\n",
      "remains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though the legends connected with the fox in Japan are usually\r\n",
      "associated with evil, Inari sometimes poses as a beneficent being,\r\n",
      "a being who can cure coughs and colds, bring wealth to the needy,\r\n",
      "and answer a woman's prayer for a child. Another kindly act on the\r\n",
      "part of Inari, which we might well have associated with Jizō, is to\r\n",
      "enable little boys and girls to bear with fortitude the troublesome\r\n",
      "performance of being shaved with a none too perfect razor, and also to\r\n",
      "help the little ones to go through the painful process of a hot bath,\r\n",
      "never less in Japan than 110° F.!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Inari not infrequently rewards human beings for any act of kindness\r\n",
      "to a fox. Only a part of his reward, however, is real; at least one\r\n",
      "tempting coin is bound to turn very quickly into grass! The little\r\n",
      "good done by Inari--and we have tried to do him justice--is altogether\r\n",
      "weighed down by his countless evil actions, often of an extremely cruel\r\n",
      "nature, as will be seen later on. The subject of the fox in Japan has\r\n",
      "been aptly described by Lafcadio Hearn as \"ghostly zoology,\" and this\r\n",
      "cunning and malignant animal is certainly ghostly with a completeness\r\n",
      "far more horribly subtle than our own stock-in-trade ghost with\r\n",
      "luminous garment and clanking chain!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Demoniacal Possession\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Demoniacal possession is frequently said to be due to the\r\n",
      "evil influence of foxes. This form of possession is known as\r\n",
      "_kitsune-tsuki_. The sufferer is usually a woman of the poorer\r\n",
      "classes, one who is highly sensitive and open to believe in all manner\r\n",
      "of superstitions. The question of demoniacal possession is still\r\n",
      "an unsolved problem, and the studies of Dr. Baelz, of the Imperial\r\n",
      "University of Japan, seem to point to the fact that animal possession\r\n",
      "in human beings is a very real and terrible truth after all.[3] He\r\n",
      "remarks that a fox usually enters a woman either through the breast or\r\n",
      "between the finger-nails, and that the fox lives a separate life of its\r\n",
      "own, frequently speaking in a voice totally different from the human.\r\n",

      "The Significance of Jizō\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jizō, the God of little children and the God who makes calm the\r\n",
      "troubled sea, is certainly the most lovable of the Buddhist divinities,\r\n",
      "though Kwannon, the Goddess of Mercy, has somewhat similar attributes.\r\n",
      "The most popular Gods, be they of the East or West, are those Gods\r\n",
      "with the most human qualities. Jizō, though of Buddhist origin, is\r\n",
      "essentially Japanese, and we may best describe him as being the\r\n",
      "creation of innumerable Japanese women who have longed to project\r\n",
      "into the Infinite, into the shrouded Beyond, a deity who should be a\r\n",
      "divine Father and Mother to the souls of their little ones. And this\r\n",
      "is just what Jizō is, a God essentially of the feminine heart, and\r\n",
      "not a being to be tossed about in the hair-splitting debates of hoary\r\n",
      "theologians. A study of the nature and characteristics of Jizō will\r\n",
      "reveal all that is best in the Japanese woman, for he assuredly reveals\r\n",
      "her love, her sense of the beautiful, and her infinite compassion. Jizō\r\n",
      "has all the wisdom of the Lord Buddha himself, with this important\r\n",
      "difference, namely, that Jizō has waived aside Nirvana, and does not\r\n",
      "sit upon the Golden Lotus, but has become, through an exquisitely\r\n",
      "beautiful self-sacrifice, the divine playmate and protector of Japanese\r\n",
      "children. He is the God of smiles and long sleeves, the enemy of evil\r\n",
      "spirits, and the one being who can heal the wound of a mother who has\r\n",
      "lost her child in death. We have a saying that all rivers find their\r\n",
      "way to the sea. To the Japanese woman who has laid her little one in\r\n",
      "the cemetery all rivers wind their silver courses into the place where\r\n",
      "the ever-waiting and ever-gentle Jizō is. That is why mothers who\r\n",
      "have lost their children in death write prayers on little slips of\r\n",
      "paper, and watch them float down the rivers on their way to the great\r\n",

      "The Significance of Japanese Art\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sir Alfred East, in lecturing on the subject of Japanese art, described\r\n",
      "it as \"great in small things, but small in great things,\" and this,\r\n",
      "generally speaking, is very true. The Japanese artist excels in\r\n",
      "depicting flowers and insects and birds. He is triumphant in portraying\r\n",
      "the curl of a wave, a branch of cherry-blossom against a full moon, a\r\n",
      "flight of heron, a group of pine-trees, and carp swimming in a stream;\r\n",
      "but that genius for minute and accurate detail seems to have prevented\r\n",
      "him from depicting what we understand as a great subject-picture,\r\n",
      "an historical scene crowded with many figures. This zest to portray\r\n",
      "various fragments from Nature was no narrow and academic affair. Art\r\n",
      "was not intended solely for the _kakemono_, or hanging scroll, to be\r\n",
      "suspended in the alcove of a Japanese home, to be admired for a time,\r\n",
      "and then to be replaced by another. Art in Japan was universal to an\r\n",
      "extent not to be found in any other country, where a cheap towel had a\r\n",
      "pleasing design upon it, and where the playing cards, unlike our own,\r\n",
      "were works of art.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has been said that the woman in Japanese art is wooden. This is not\r\n",
      "really so, if by wooden we mean entirely without expression; but it is\r\n",
      "necessary first of all to know something about the Japanese woman in\r\n",
      "actual life before we can understand her representation in art. There\r\n",
      "is a wealth of old tradition behind that apparently immobile face. It\r\n",
      "is a curious fact that until we get accustomed to the various Japanese\r\n",
      "types one face so closely resembles another that discrimination is out\r\n",
      "of the question, and we are apt to run away with the idea that Nature\r\n",
      "in Japan has been content to repeat the same physiognomy over and over\r\n",
      "again, forgetting that we in turn present no diversity of type to the\r\n",
      "Japanese on first acquaintance. The Japanese face in art is not without\r\n",
      "expression, only it happens to be an expression rather different\r\n",
      "from that with which we are familiar, and this is particularly true\r\n",
      "in regard to the portrayal of Japanese women. Most of us have seen a\r\n",
      "number of colour-prints devoted to this subject in which we find no\r\n",
      "shading in the face. We are apt to exclaim that this omission gives an\r\n",
      "extremely flat effect to the face, and to observe in consequence that\r\n",
      "the work before us must be very bad art. But it is not bad art, for the\r\n",
      "Japanese face _is_ flat, and the artists of that country never fail to\r\n",
      "reflect this characteristic. Colour-prints depicting Nipponese women\r\n",
      "do not reveal emotion--a smile, a gesture of yearning, are absent; but\r\n",
      "because we find so much negation we should be very far from the truth\r\n",
      "to suppose that a colour-print of this kind expresses no feeling,\r\n",
      "that the general effect is doll-like and uninteresting. We must take\r\n",
      "into consideration the long period of suppression through which the\r\n",
      "Japanese woman had to pass. A superficial study of that extraordinary\r\n",
      "treatise by Kaibara known as _Onna Daigaku_, or \"The Greater Learning\r\n",
      "for Women,\" will help us to realise that it was the duty of every\r\n",
      "Japanese woman to be sweet, amiable, virtuous; to obey those in\r\n",
      "authority without demur, and above all to suppress her feelings. When\r\n",
      "we have taken these points into consideration we shall very slowly\r\n",
      "perceive that there is strength and not weakness in a portrait of a\r\n",
      "Japanese woman; a quiet and dignified beauty in which impulse is held\r\n",
      "in check, veiled, as it were, behind a cloud of rigid tradition. The\r\n",
      "Japanese woman, though she has been surrounded at every turn by severe\r\n",
      "discipline, has, nevertheless, given us a type of womanhood supreme\r\n",
      "in her true sweetness of disposition, and the Japanese artist has\r\n",
      "caught the glamour of her charm. In the curve of her form he suggests\r\n",
      "the grace of a wind-blown willow, in the designs upon her robe the\r\n",
      "promise of spring, and behind the small red mouth a wealth of infinite\r\n",
      "possibilities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Japan owed her art to Buddhism, and it was quickened and sustained by\r\n",
      "Chinese influence. Buddhism gave Nippon her pictorial art, her mural\r\n",
      "decoration and exquisite carving. Shintō temples were severe and plain,\r\n",
      "those of Buddhism were replete with all that art could give them; and\r\n",
      "last, but not least, it was Buddha's teaching that brought into Japan\r\n",
      "the art of gardening, with all its elaborate and beautiful symbolism.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A Japanese art critic wrote: \"If in the midst of a stroke a sword-cut\r\n",
      "had severed the brush it would have bled.\" From this we may gather\r\n",
      "that the Japanese artist put his whole heart into his work; it was a\r\n",
      "part of him, something vital, something akin to religion itself. With\r\n",
      "this great force behind his brush it is no wonder that he was able to\r\n",
      "give that extraordinary life and movement to his work, so strikingly\r\n",
      "depicted in portraits of actors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though we have so far only shown the Japanese artist as a master\r\n",
      "of little things, he has, nevertheless, faithfully and effectively\r\n",
      "represented the Gods and Goddesses of his country, and many of the\r\n",
      "myths and legends connected with them. If he excelled in the beautiful,\r\n",
      "he no less excelled in depicting the horrible, for no artists,\r\n",
      "excepting those of China, have succeeded in portraying the supernatural\r\n",
      "to more effect. What a contrast there is between an exquisite picture\r\n",
      "of Jizō or Buddha or Kwannon and the pictorial representation of a\r\n",
      "Japanese goblin! Extreme beauty and extreme ugliness are to be found in\r\n",
      "Japanese art, and those who love the many pictures of Mount Fuji and\r\n",

      "with the legends in Japanese art not hitherto mentioned. The favourite\r\n",
      "theme of the Japanese artist is undoubtedly that of the Seven Gods of\r\n",
      "Good Fortune, nearly always treated with rollicking good-humour. There\r\n",
      "was Fukurokuju, with a very long head, and attended by a crane, deer,\r\n",
      "or tortoise; Daikoku, who stood upon rice-bales and was accompanied by\r\n",
      "a rat; Ebisu, carrying a fish; Hotei, the merry God of Laughter, the\r\n",
      "very embodiment of our phrase \"Laugh and grow fat.\" There was Bishamon,\r\n",
      "resplendent in armour, and bearing a spear and toy pagoda; Benten, the\r\n",
      "Goddess of Beauty, Wealth, Fertility, and Offspring; while Jurōjin was\r\n",
      "very similar to Fukurokuju. These Seven Gods of Good Fortune, or, to\r\n",
      "be more accurate, six Gods and one Goddess, seem to have sprung from\r\n",

      "with his wife and children. One night, just as Visu was about to fall\r\n",
      "asleep, he heard a most extraordinary sound coming from under the\r\n",

      "that he and his family were about to be destroyed by an earthquake,\r\n",
      "hastily snatched up the younger children and rushed to the door of\r\n",
      "the hut, where he saw a most wonderful sight. Instead of the once\r\n",
      "desolate plain he perceived a great mountain from whose head sprang\r\n",
      "tongues of flame and dense clouds of smoke! So glorious was the sight\r\n",
      "of this mountain that had run under the earth for two hundred miles and\r\n",
      "then suddenly sprung forth on the plain of Suruga that Visu, his wife\r\n",
      "and family, sat down on the ground as if under a spell. When the sun\r\n",
      "rose the next morning Visu saw that the mountain had put on robes of\r\n",
      "opal. It seemed so impressive to him that he called it Fuji-yama (\"The\r\n",
      "Never-dying Mountain\"), and so it is called to this day. Such perfect\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "One day Visu received a visit from an old priest, who said to him:\r\n",
      "\"Honourable woodman, I am afraid you never pray.\" Visu replied: \"If\r\n",
      "you had a wife and a large family to keep you would never have time\r\n",
      "to pray.\" This remark made the priest angry, and the old man gave the\r\n",
      "woodcutter a vivid description of the horror of being reborn as a toad,\r\n",
      "or a mouse, or an insect for millions of years. Such lurid details were\r\n",
      "not to Visu's liking, and he accordingly promised the priest that in\r\n",
      "future he would pray. \"Work and pray,\" said the priest as he took his\r\n",
      "departure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unfortunately Visu did nothing but pray. He prayed all day long and\r\n",
      "refused to do any work, so that his rice crops withered and his wife\r\n",
      "and family starved. Visu's wife, who had hitherto never said a harsh or\r\n",
      "bitter word to her husband, now became extremely angry, and, pointing\r\n",
      "to the poor thin bodies of her children, she exclaimed: \"Rise, Visu,\r\n",
      "take up your axe and do something more helpful to us all than the mere\r\n",
      "mumbling of prayers!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Visu was so utterly amazed at what his wife had said that it was some\r\n",
      "time before he could think of a fitting reply. When he did so his words\r\n",
      "came hot and strong to the ears of his poor, much-wronged wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Woman,\" said he, \"the Gods come first. You are an impertinent creature\r\n",
      "to speak to me so, and I will have nothing more to do with you!\" Visu\r\n",
      "snatched up his axe and, without looking round to say farewell, he left\r\n",
      "the hut, strode out of the wood, and climbed up Fuji-yama, where a mist\r\n",
      "hid him from sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Visu had seated himself upon the mountain he heard a soft rustling\r\n",
      "sound, and immediately afterward saw a fox dart into a thicket. Now\r\n",
      "Visu deemed it extremely lucky to see a fox, and, forgetting his\r\n",
      "prayers, he sprang up, and ran hither and thither in the hope of again\r\n",
      "finding this sharp-nosed little creature. He was about to give up\r\n",
      "the chase when, coming to an open space in a wood, he saw two ladies\r\n",
      "sitting down by a brook playing _go_.[4] The woodman was so completely\r\n",
      "fascinated that he could do nothing but sit down and watch them.\r\n",
      "There was no sound except the soft click of pieces on the board and\r\n",
      "the song of the running brook. The ladies took no notice of Visu, for\r\n",
      "they seemed to be playing a strange game that had no end, a game that\r\n",
      "entirely absorbed their attention. Visu could not keep his eyes off\r\n",
      "these fair women. He watched their long black hair and the little quick\r\n",
      "hands that shot out now and again from their big silk sleeves in order\r\n",
      "to move the pieces. After he had been sitting there for three hundred\r\n",
      "years, though to him it was but a summer's afternoon, he saw that one\r\n",
      "of the players had made a false move. \"_Wrongs_ most lovely lady!\" he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Japanese bells are among the finest in the world, for in their size,\r\n",
      "construction, and decoration the bell-maker of Nippon has reached a\r\n",
      "high level of efficiency. The largest bell in Japan belongs to the Jodo\r\n",
      "temple of Chion, at Kyōtō. It weighs seventy-four tons, and requires\r\n",
      "seventy-five men to ring it in order to get the full effect from this\r\n",
      "great mass of metal. The bell of Enkakuji is the largest bell in\r\n",
      "Kamakura. It dates from the beginning of the thirteenth century, and is\r\n",
      "six inches thick, four feet seven inches in diameter, and about eight\r\n",
      "feet high. This bell, unlike our own, is the same diameter from top to\r\n",
      "bottom, a feature common to all big Japanese bells. It is rung by means\r\n",
      "of a beam suspended from the roof, and from the beam hangs a rope.\r\n",
      "When the beam is set swinging with sufficient velocity it strikes a\r\n",
      "lotus-moulding on the side of the bell, and a great note quivers forth,\r\n",
      "\"deep as thunder, rich as the bass of a mighty organ.\"\r\n",

      "earthly life too soon, and that he must at once return. Ono-no-Kimi\r\n",
      "pleaded that he could not retrace his steps, as he did not know the\r\n",
      "way. Then Emma-Ō said: \"By listening to the bell of Enkakuji you will\r\n",
      "be able to find your way into the world again.\" And Ono-no-Kimi went\r\n",
      "forth from the Judgment Seat, and, with the sound of the bell for\r\n",

      "in the country, and no one knew his name or whence he had come. With\r\n",
      "unceasing zest he travelled up and down the land, from village to\r\n",
      "village, from town to town, exhorting the people to pray before the\r\n",
      "bell of Enkakuji. It was eventually discovered that this giant priest\r\n",
      "was none other than a personification of the holy bell itself. This\r\n",
      "extraordinary news had its effect, for numerous people now flocked to\r\n",
      "the bell of Enkakuji, prayed, and returned with many a wish fulfilled.\r\n",
      "On another occasion this sacred bell is said to have sounded a deep\r\n",
      "note of its own accord. Those who were incredulous and laughed at the\r\n",
      "miracle met with calamity, and those who believed in the miraculous\r\n",

      "A Woman and the Bell of Miidera\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the ancient monastery of Miidera there was a great bronze bell. It\r\n",
      "rang out every morning and evening, a clear, rich note, and its surface\r\n",
      "shone like sparkling dew. The priests would not allow any woman to\r\n",
      "strike it, because they thought that such an action would pollute and\r\n",
      "dull the metal, as well as bring calamity upon them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When a certain pretty woman who lived in Kyōto heard this she grew\r\n",
      "extremely inquisitive, and at last, unable to restrain her curiosity,\r\n",
      "she said: \"I will go and see this wonderful bell of Miidera. I will\r\n",
      "make it sound forth a soft note, and in its shining surface, bigger and\r\n",
      "brighter than a thousand mirrors, I will paint and powder, my face and\r\n",
      "dress my hair.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length this vain and irreverent woman reached the belfry in which\r\n",
      "the great bell was suspended at a time when all were absorbed in their\r\n",
      "sacred duties. She looked into the gleaming bell and saw her pretty\r\n",
      "eyes, flushed cheeks, and laughing dimples. Presently she stretched\r\n",
      "forth her little fingers, lightly touched the shining metal, and prayed\r\n",
      "that she might have as great and splendid a mirror for her own. When\r\n",
      "the bell felt this woman's fingers, the bronze that she touched shrank,\r\n",
      "leaving a little hollow, and losing at the same time all its exquisite\r\n",
      "polish.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Benkei,[1] the faithful retainer of Yoshitsune, may be fittingly\r\n",
      "described as the strong man of Old Japan. His strength was prodigious,\r\n",
      "as will be seen in the following legend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Benkei was a monk he very much desired to steal the bell of\r\n",
      "Miidera, and bring it to his own monastery. He accordingly visited\r\n",
      "Miidera, and, at an opportune moment, unhooked the great bell. Benkei's\r\n",
      "first thought was to roll it down the hill, and thus save himself the\r\n",
      "trouble of carrying such a huge piece of metal; but, thinking that the\r\n",
      "monks would hear the noise, he was forced to set about carrying it\r\n",
      "down the steep incline. He accordingly pulled out the crossbeam from\r\n",
      "the belfry, suspended the bell at one end, and--humorous touch--his\r\n",
      "paper lantern at the other,[2] and in this manner he carried his mighty\r\n",
      "burden for nearly seven miles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Benkei reached his temple he at once demanded food. He managed\r\n",
      "to get through a concoction which filled an iron soup-pot five feet\r\n",
      "in diameter, and when he had finished he gave permission for a few\r\n",
      "priests to strike the stolen bell of Miidera. The bell was struck, but\r\n",
      "in its dying murmur it seemed to cry: \"I want to go back to Miidera! I\r\n",
      "want to go back to Miidera!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the priests heard this they were amazed. The abbot, however,\r\n",
      "thought that if the bell were sprinkled with holy water it would become\r\n",
      "reconciled to its new abode; but in spite of holy water the bell\r\n",
      "still sobbed forth its plaintive and provoking cry. No one was more\r\n",
      "displeased by the sound than Benkei himself. It seemed that the bell\r\n",
      "mocked him and that arduous journey of his. At last, exasperated beyond\r\n",
      "endurance, he rushed to the rope, strained it till the beam was far\r\n",
      "from the great piece of metal, then let it go, hoping that the force of\r\n",
      "the swift-rushing beam would crack such a peevish and ill-bred bell.\r\n",
      "The whirling wood reached the bell with a terrific crash; but it did\r\n",
      "not break. Through the air rang again: \"I want to go back to Miidera!\"\r\n",
      "and whether the bell was struck harshly or softly it always spoke the\r\n",
      "same words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last Benkei, now in a towering rage, shouldered the bell and beam,\r\n",
      "and, coming to the top of a mountain, he set down his burden, and, with\r\n",
      "a mighty kick, sent it rolling into the valley beneath. Some time later\r\n",
      "the Miidera priests found their precious bell, and joyfully hung it in\r\n",
      "its accustomed place, and from that time it failed to speak, and only\r\n",
      "rang like other temple bells.\r\n",

      "are the stories, both true and legendary, told in connection with this\r\n",
      "theme. Of the former Lafcadio Hearn in \"Kokoro\" narrates the pitiful\r\n",
      "tale of a priest who had the misfortune to attract the love of many\r\n",
      "women. Rather than yield to their solicitations he committed suicide by\r\n",
      "kneeling in the middle of a railway track and allowing an express train\r\n",
      "to put an end to his temptations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The story of \"The Bamboo-cutter and the Moon-Maiden\" gives us another\r\n",
      "representation of the working out of Karma. The Lady Kaguya was\r\n",
      "banished from her home in the moon owing to indulgence in some sensual\r\n",
      "passion. In her exile it will be remembered that her weakness was\r\n",
      "vanquished, and that she steadfastly resisted this particular sin\r\n",
      "during her earthly sojourn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Karma by no means represents exclusively the power of evil thought,\r\n",
      "though it is most commonly applied to the human passions. In its fuller\r\n",
      "meaning it signifies cause and effect--all thoughts, all actions that\r\n",
      "are not spiritual, for by the working of Karma, according to Buddhist\r\n",
      "teaching, is the world and all it contains fashioned. The desire to be\r\n",
      "is Karma. The desire not to be is the breaking of the great wheel of\r\n",
      "birth and re-birth, and the attainment of Nirvana.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are Japanese lovers who, owing to circumstance, are unable to\r\n",

      "as the result of an error in a previous existence, such as breaking\r\n",
      "their promise to wed, or because they were cruel to each other.\r\n",
      "Such lovers believe that if they bind themselves together with an\r\n",
      "under-girdle and spring into a river or lake they will become united in\r\n",
      "their next birth. This suicide of Japanese lovers is called _jōshi_,\r\n",
      "which means \"love-death\" or \"passion-death.\" Buddhism is strongly\r\n",
      "opposed to self-destruction, and no less to a love of this kind, for\r\n",
      "in _jōshi_ there is no desire to destroy, but rather to foster, the\r\n",

      "Mosaku and his apprentice Minokichi journeyed to a forest, some little\r\n",
      "distance from their village. It was a bitterly cold night when they\r\n",
      "neared their destination, and saw in front of them a cold sweep of\r\n",
      "water. They desired to cross this river, but the ferryman had gone\r\n",
      "away, leaving his boat on the other side of the water, and as the\r\n",
      "weather was too inclement to admit of swimming across the river they\r\n",
      "were glad to take shelter in the ferryman's little hut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mosaku fell asleep almost immediately he entered this humble but\r\n",
      "welcome shelter. Minokichi, however, lay awake for a long time\r\n",
      "listening to the cry of the wind and the hiss of the snow as it was\r\n",
      "blown against the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Minokichi at last fell asleep, to be soon awakened by a shower of snow\r\n",
      "falling across his face. He found that the door had been blown open,\r\n",
      "and that standing in the room was a fair woman in dazzlingly white\r\n",
      "garments. For a moment she stood thus; then she bent over Mosaku, her\r\n",
      "breath coming forth like white smoke. After bending thus over the old\r\n",
      "man for a minute or two she turned to Minokichi and hovered over him.\r\n",
      "He tried to cry out, for the breath of this woman was like a freezing\r\n",
      "blast of wind. She told him that she had intended to treat him as she\r\n",
      "had done the old man at his side, but forbore on account of his youth\r\n",
      "and beauty. Threatening Minokichi with instant death if he dared to\r\n",
      "mention to any one what he had seen, she suddenly vanished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Minokichi called out to his beloved master: \"Mosaku, Mosaku,\r\n",
      "wake! Something very terrible has happened!\" But there was no reply.\r\n",
      "He touched the hand of his master in the dark, and found it was like a\r\n",
      "piece of ice. Mosaku was dead!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the next winter, while Minokichi was returning home, he chanced\r\n",
      "to meet a pretty girl by the name of Yuki. She informed him that she\r\n",
      "was going to Yedo, where she desired to find a situation as a servant.\r\n",
      "Minokichi was charmed with this maiden, and he went so far as to ask if\r\n",
      "she were betrothed, and hearing that she was not, he took her to his\r\n",
      "own home, and in due time married her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yuki presented her husband with ten fine and handsome children, fairer\r\n",
      "of skin than the average. When Minokichi's mother died her last words\r\n",
      "were in praise of Yuki, and her eulogy was echoed by many of the\r\n",
      "country folk in the district.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night, while Yuki was sewing, the light of a paper lamp shining\r\n",
      "upon her face, Minokichi recalled the extraordinary experience he had\r\n",
      "had in the ferryman's hut. \"Yuki,\" said he, \"you remind me so much of a\r\n",
      "beautiful white woman I saw when I was eighteen years old. She killed\r\n",
      "my master with her ice-cold breath. I am sure she was some strange\r\n",
      "spirit, and yet to-night she seems to resemble you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yuki flung down her sewing. There was a horrible smile on her face\r\n",
      "as she bent close to her husband and shrieked: \"It was I, Yuki-Onna,\r\n",
      "who came to you then, and silently killed your master! Oh, faithless\r\n",
      "wretch, you have broken your promise to keep the matter secret, and if\r\n",
      "it were not for our sleeping children I would kill you now! Remember,\r\n",
      "if they have aught to complain of at your hands I shall hear, I shall\r\n",
      "know, and on a night when the snow falls I _will_ kill you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Yuki-Onna, the Lady of the Snow, changed into a white mist, and,\r\n",
      "shrieking and shuddering, passed through the smoke-hole, never to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "According to Mr. R. Gordon Smith, in his \"Ancient Tales and Folk-lore\r\n",
      "of Japan,\" \"all those who die by the snow and cold become spirits\r\n",
      "of snow.\" That is to say, all those who perish in this way become\r\n",
      "identified with Yuki-Onna, the Lady of the Snow. The following legend\r\n",
      "is adapted from Mr. Smith's book referred to above.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kyuzaemon, a poor farmer, had closed the shutters of his humble\r\n",
      "dwelling and retired to rest. Shortly before midnight he was awakened\r\n",
      "by loud tapping. Going to the door, he exclaimed: \"Who are you? What do\r\n",
      "you want?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The strange visitor made no attempt to answer these questions, but\r\n",
      "persistently begged for food and shelter. The cautious Kyuzaemon\r\n",
      "refused to allow the visitor to enter, and, having seen that his\r\n",
      "dwelling was secure, he was about to retire to bed again, when he saw\r\n",
      "standing beside him a woman in white flowing garments, her hair falling\r\n",
      "over her shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where did you leave your _geta_?\" demanded the frightened farmer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The white woman informed him that she was the visitor who had tapped\r\n",
      "upon his door. \"I need no _geta_,\" she said, \"for I have no feet! I\r\n",
      "fly over the snow-capped trees, and should have proceeded to the next\r\n",
      "village, but the wind was blowing strongly against me, and I desired to\r\n",
      "rest awhile.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The farmer expressed his fear of spirits, whereupon the woman inquired\r\n",
      "if her host had a _butsudan_ (a family altar). Finding that he had,\r\n",
      "she bade him open the _butsudan_ and light a lamp. When this was done\r\n",
      "the woman prayed before the ancestral tablets, not forgetting to add a\r\n",
      "prayer for the still much-agitated Kyuzaemon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having paid her respects at the _butsudan_, she informed the farmer\r\n",
      "that her name was Oyasu, and that she had lived with her parents and\r\n",
      "her husband, Isaburo. When she died her husband left her parents,\r\n",
      "and it was her intention to try to persuade him to go back again and\r\n",
      "support the old people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kyuzaemon began to understand as he murmured to himself: \"Oyasu\r\n",
      "perished in the snow, and this is her spirit I see before me.\" However,\r\n",
      "in spite of this recollection he still felt much afraid. He sought the\r\n",
      "family altar with trembling footsteps, repeating over and over again:\r\n",
      "\"Namu Amida Butsu!\" (\"Hail, Omnipotent Buddha!\")\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the farmer went to bed and fell asleep. Once he woke up to hear\r\n",

      "informed him that he had received numerous visits from the spirit of\r\n",

      "matter Kyuzaemon found that this Lady of the Snow had appeared before\r\n",

      "geraniums, yellow calceolarias, blue lobelias, the green grass and the\r\n",

      "matter is that we do not understand the art of flower arrangement. We\r\n",
      "buy flowers just to make the garden look bright, under the impression\r\n",
      "that brightness is an abstract quality with which we should like to\r\n",
      "spend our summer days. An Englishman once attempted to make a landscape\r\n",

      "failed in his attempt to imitate because he considered gardening a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "One of the most striking, and certainly one of the most pleasing,\r\n",
      "characteristics of the Japanese is their intense love of flowers\r\n",
      "and trees. Merry parties set out to see the azaleas bloom, or the\r\n",
      "splendour of the pink-white cherry-blossom, or the scarlet glory of\r\n",
      "the maple-trees. This \"flower-viewing\" is an integral part of their\r\n",
      "existence. The very _kimono_ of the laughing children look like little\r\n",
      "gardens of flowers themselves. Take away their landscape, and you take\r\n",
      "away at once their sense of poetry, and, we may almost add, the floral\r\n",
      "side of their religion too, for the Japanese worship flowers and trees\r\n",
      "in a way utterly impossible to the more prosaic Westerner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During a recent spring the magnolia-trees in Kew Gardens afforded\r\n",
      "a wonderfully beautiful spectacle. But there were few to see these\r\n",
      "leafless trees with their profusion of lotus-like blossom. The most\r\n",
      "appreciative spectator was a child, who sat under the sweet-scented\r\n",
      "branches, gathered the fallen petals in her little brown hands,\r\n",
      "and made up a quaint story as she did so. But in Japan, where\r\n",
      "magnolia-trees bloom too, a hundred little poems would be threaded\r\n",
      "to the branches, and little cakes made in imitation of the petals.\r\n",
      "Perhaps, too, a branch of magnolia would be set in a vase, the\r\n",
      "object of silent admiration of the members of some tea ceremony. And\r\n",
      "afterwards the spray of blossom would be gently placed on a river or\r\n",
      "buried with joy and reverence for the beauty it had exhibited in its\r\n",
      "brief hour of life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The love of flowers is only a small part of the Japanese love of\r\n",
      "Nature. There was an evolutionary growth in this worship as in every\r\n",
      "other, and we are inclined to think that the Japanese go very far\r\n",
      "back in this matter, and learnt first of all to love rocks and stones.\r\n",
      "To us rocks and stones are of interest only to the geologist and\r\n",
      "metallurgist, merely from a scientific point of view, and it seems\r\n",
      "almost incredible that rocks and stones have a poetical meaning. But\r\n",
      "it is otherwise to the Japanese. The Japanese garden is essentially a\r\n",
      "landscape garden. The owner of a garden falls in love with a certain\r\n",
      "view. It haunts him, and awakens in him some primitive feelings of\r\n",
      "delight that cannot be analysed. He brings that view perpetually before\r\n",
      "him in his garden, in miniature, perhaps, but a miniature of wonderful\r\n",
      "exactness. His garden thus becomes a place of happy memory, and not\r\n",
      "a plot laid out with gaudy flowers and terraces that can have no\r\n",
      "meaning, no poetry to his mind. Without a doubt Japanese gardens, with\r\n",
      "their gorgeous flowers, merry sunshine, and the sweet tinkle of dainty\r\n",
      "fairy-bells suspended from the branches of the trees, are the most\r\n",

      "One thing that strikes us about Japanese gardens that we do not find in\r\n",
      "England is the wonderful economy displayed in their schemes. Suburbia\r\n",
      "often makes the excuse that their pocket-handkerchief of a garden is\r\n",
      "much too small to be made beautiful. Too small to be made beautiful?\r\n",
      "Why, the Japanese can make a wonderful little garden in a space no\r\n",
      "bigger than a soup-plate! Necessity is the mother of invention, and if\r\n",
      "we only loved Nature more we should soon find the means to make our\r\n",
      "smallest gardens attractive. The great Japanese designer of gardens,\r\n",
      "Kobori-Enshiu, said that an ideal garden should be like \"the sweet\r\n",
      "solitude of a landscape clouded by moonlight, with a half-gloom between\r\n",
      "the trees.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Miss Florence Du Cane has much to say concerning Japanese rocks and\r\n",
      "stones. What poetry is suggested in the names of some of these garden\r\n",
      "stones--for example, \"The Stone of Easy Rest.\" Then, among the lake\r\n",
      "stones we have one called \"Wild Wave Stone,\" that at once suggests\r\n",
      "Matsushima, with its waves breaking against innumerable rocks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The stone or wooden lamps are very important ornaments in a Japanese\r\n",
      "garden. The idea was borrowed from Korea, and they are still sometimes\r\n",
      "known as \"Korean towers.\" They are seldom lit, except in temple\r\n",
      "gardens, but they need no jewel of light to make them beautiful. They\r\n",
      "are rich in amber and green moss, and in the winter they catch the\r\n",
      "snow and make ghost lanterns of exquisite beauty. Another feature of\r\n",
      "a Japanese garden is the _Torii_, a simple arch of wood shaped like a\r\n",
      "huge Chinese character. Shintō in origin, no one has as yet discovered\r\n",
      "what they were originally intended to represent, though there have\r\n",
      "been many diverse opinions on the subject. These gates to nowhere are\r\n",
      "extremely fascinating, and to look at them with the sea about their\r\n",
      "feet is to dream of a far-away fairy tale of childhood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lakes, cascades, tiny bridges, the stepping-stones over the winding\r\n",
      "ways of silver sand, form a place of retreat indeed. And then the\r\n",
      "colour of the Japanese garden! Every month has some fresh colour scene\r\n",
      "as the plum and cherry and peach-trees come into bloom. Trailing over\r\n",
      "the ground among the pine-needles or looking into the clear blue lake,\r\n",
      "one may see the azaleas. If there were ever a flower that personified\r\n",
      "colour then it is surely the azalea. It is the rainbow of flowers,\r\n",
      "and there seems scarcely a shade of colour not to be found in its\r\n",
      "blossoms. To look at the azaleas is to look into the very paint-box of\r\n",
      "Nature herself. Then at another season of the year we get the iris in\r\n",
      "purple and lavender, yellow and white, or the beautiful rose-coloured\r\n",
      "lotus that opens with a little explosion on the placid waters, as if\r\n",
      "to herald its coming to perfection. The last colour glory of the year\r\n",
      "is the splendour of the maple-trees. We have a fine crimson effect in\r\n",
      "our English blackberry leaves, but they lie hidden in the wet autumn\r\n",
      "hedges. In Japan the maples do not hide. They seem everywhere alive\r\n",
      "in a splendid flame. In the autumn it appears as if the maple-trees\r\n",
      "had conjured with the sunset, for at that time Japan is not the Land\r\n",
      "of the Rising Sun, but the land of the sun going down in a great\r\n",
      "pageant of red leaves. And is that the end of Nature's work for the\r\n",
      "year? No, indeed. Last of all comes the snow, and the beauty of its\r\n",
      "effect lies not so much in the soft flakes themselves, but in the way\r\n",
      "they are caught and held upon the beautiful little houses and temples\r\n",
      "and lanterns. See a Japanese garden then, and you see the white seal\r\n",
      "of Nature's approval upon it all. The snow scene is perhaps Nature's\r\n",
      "supreme touch in Japan, after all; and it is a scene dear to the hearts\r\n",
      "of the Japanese. In midsummer a Japanese emperor once had the miniature\r\n",
      "mountains in his gardens covered with white silk to suggest snow,\r\n",
      "and, no doubt, to give an imaginary coolness to the scene. A slight\r\n",
      "acquaintance with Japanese art will reveal the fact that snow affords a\r\n",

      "admitted that a pine-tree is a more graceful talisman than a rusty\r\n",
      "old horse-shoe. In a certain Japanese play we find the following:\r\n",
      "\"The emblem of unchangeableness--exalted is their fame to the end of\r\n",
      "time--the fame of the two pine-trees that have grown old together.\"\r\n",
      "This refers to the famous pines of Takasago. Mr. Conder tells us\r\n",
      "that at wedding feasts \"a branch of the _male_ pine is placed in one\r\n",
      "vessel and a branch of the _female_ pine in the other. The general\r\n",
      "form of each design would be similar, but the branch of the _female_\r\n",
      "pine facing the opposite vase should stretch a little beneath the\r\n",
      "corresponding branch of the _male_ pine.\" In other words, it shows\r\n",
      "that Woman's Suffrage exists not in Japan, and that the Japanese wife\r\n",
      "is subject to her lord and master, which is a very pretty way of\r\n",
      "suggesting, what is in England a very dangerous subject. The design\r\n",
      "referred to above typifies \"eternal union.\" The pine-tree really\r\n",

      "sun banner pure and simple was adopted; but a plain orb without rays\r\n",

      "youth for the purpose of administering severe admonition. The Lord of\r\n",

      "Regent, Saimyoji Tokiyori. When thirty years of age this Regent retired\r\n",
      "to a monastery for several years, and not infrequently his peace of\r\n",
      "mind was sadly disturbed by stories of peasants who suffered at the\r\n",
      "hands of tyrannical officials. Now Tokiyori loved above everything\r\n",
      "the welfare of his people, and after giving the matter careful\r\n",

      "finding shelter, he was about to make the best of the matter by\r\n",
      "sleeping under a tree when, to his joy, he noticed a small thatched\r\n",
      "cottage nestling under a hill at no great distance. To this cottage\r\n",
      "he went, and explained to the woman who greeted him that he had lost\r\n",
      "his way and would be much indebted to her if she would afford him\r\n",
      "shelter for the night. The good woman explained that as her husband\r\n",
      "was away from home, it would be disloyal as his wife to give shelter\r\n",
      "to a stranger. Tokiyori not only took this reply in good part, but\r\n",
      "he greatly rejoiced, in spite of a night in the snow, to find such a\r\n",
      "virtuous woman. But he had not gone far from the cottage when he heard\r\n",
      "a man calling to him. Tokiyori stood still, and presently he saw some\r\n",
      "one beckoning him. The man explained that he was the husband of the\r\n",
      "woman the ex-Regent had just left, and cordially invited one whom he\r\n",
      "took to be a wandering priest to return with him and accept such humble\r\n",
      "hospitality as was available.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Tokiyori was sitting in the little cottage simple fare was\r\n",
      "spread before him, and as he had eaten nothing since the morning he\r\n",
      "did full justice to the meal. But the fact that millet and not rice\r\n",
      "was provided clearly conveyed to the observant Tokiyori that here was\r\n",
      "poverty indeed, but with it all a generosity that went straight to his\r\n",
      "heart. Nor was this all, for, the meal finished, they gathered round\r\n",
      "the fire that was fast dying out for want of fuel. The good man of the\r\n",
      "house turned to the fuel-box. Alas! it was empty. Without a moment's\r\n",
      "hesitation he went out into the garden, heavily covered with snow,\r\n",
      "and brought back with him three pots of dwarf trees, pine, plum, and\r\n",
      "cherry. Now in Japan dwarf trees are held in high esteem; much time and\r\n",
      "care is bestowed upon them, and their age and unique beauty have made\r\n",
      "them dear to the people of Nippon. In spite of Tokiyori's remonstrance\r\n",
      "his host broke up these little trees, and thus made a cheerful blaze.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was this incident, scarcely to be fully appreciated by a Westerner,\r\n",
      "that caused Tokiyori to question his host, whose very possession of\r\n",
      "these valuable trees strongly suggested that this generous man was\r\n",
      "not a farmer by birth, but had taken to this calling by force of\r\n",
      "circumstance. The ex-Regent's conjecture proved to be correct, and his\r\n",
      "host, with some reluctance, finally explained that he was a _samurai_\r\n",
      "by the name of Sano Genzalmon Tsuneyo. He had been forced to take up\r\n",
      "farming owing to the dishonesty of one of his relatives.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tokiyori readily recalled the name of this _samurai_ before him, and\r\n",
      "suggested that he should make an appeal for redress. Sano explained\r\n",
      "that as the good and just Regent had died (so he thought), and as his\r\n",
      "successor was very young, he considered it was worse than useless to\r\n",
      "present a petition. But, nevertheless, he went on to explain to his\r\n",
      "interested listener that should there come a call to arms he would be\r\n",
      "the first to make an appearance at Kamakura. It was this thought of\r\n",
      "some day being of use to his country that had sweetened the days of his\r\n",
      "poverty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The conversation, so rapidly suggested in this story, was in reality\r\n",
      "a lengthy one, and by the time it was concluded already a new day\r\n",
      "had begun. And when the storm-doors had been opened it was to reveal\r\n",
      "sunlight streaming over a world of snow. Before taking his departure\r\n",
      "Tokiyori warmly thanked his host and hostess for their hospitality.\r\n",
      "When this kindly visitor had gone Sano suddenly remembered that he had\r\n",
      "forgotten to inquire the name of his guest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now it happened that in the following spring a call to arms was\r\n",
      "instituted by the Government at Kamakura. No sooner had Sano heard\r\n",
      "the joyful news than he set out to obey the summons. His armour was\r\n",
      "shabby in the extreme, his halberd covered with rust, and his horse\r\n",
      "was in a very poor condition. He presented a sorry figure among the\r\n",
      "resplendent knights he found in Kamakura. Many of these knights made\r\n",
      "uncomplimentary remarks concerning him, but Sano bore this insolence\r\n",
      "without a word. While he stood, a forlorn figure, among the sparkling\r\n",
      "ranks of _samurai_ about him, a herald approached riding on a\r\n",
      "magnificent horse, and carrying a banner bearing the house-crest of\r\n",
      "the Regent. With a loud, clear voice he bade the knight wearing the\r\n",
      "shabbiest armour to appear before his master. Sano obeyed the summons\r\n",
      "with a heavy heart. He thought that the Regent was about to rebuke him\r\n",

      "the attention of men of science. After much speculation, it has been\r\n",
      "clearly proved by Professors Ayrton and Perry to arise from the fact\r\n",
      "that the curvature of the face of the mirror over the plain part of\r\n",
      "the back is greater than over the design.\" It is the phenomenon rather\r\n",
      "than the possible explanation of it that interests us, and no doubt\r\n",

      "received a visit from the Soul of the Mirror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "beautiful than ever, and the refulgence of her beauty was like summer\r\n",
      "moonlight. After she had saluted Matsumura she explained that she was\r\n",
      "indeed the Soul of the Mirror, and narrated how she had fallen into\r\n",
      "the possession of Lady Kamo, of the Imperial Court, and how she had\r\n",
      "become an heirloom of the Fujiwara House, until during the period of\r\n",
      "Hōgen, when the Taira and Minamoto clans were engaged in conflict, she\r\n",

      "On the following day Matsumura left the house, and, as Yayoi had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Hundreds of mirrors were given for this purpose, and all were offered\r\n",

      "the back known as the _Shō-Chiku-Bai_, or the three emblems of the\r\n",
      "Pine, Bamboo, and Plum-flower. She yearned to stretch forth her arm\r\n",
      "between the railings and to snatch back her beloved mirror. Her soul\r\n",
      "was in the shining surface, and it mingled with the souls of those who\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When the Mugenyama bell was in course of construction the bell-founders\r\n",
      "discovered that one mirror would not melt. The workers said that it\r\n",
      "refused to melt because the owner had afterwards regretted the gift,\r\n",
      "which had made the metal hard, as hard as the woman's selfish heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon every one knew the identity of the giver of the mirror that would\r\n",
      "not melt, and, angry and ashamed, the farmer's wife drowned herself,\r\n",

      "to melt my mirror, and so cast the bell. My soul will come to him who\r\n",
      "breaks that bell by ringing it, and I will give him great wealth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the woman died her old mirror melted immediately, and the bell\r\n",

      "heard of the message written by the deceased farmer's wife, a great\r\n",
      "multitude came to the temple, and one by one rang the bell with the\r\n",
      "utmost violence in the hope of breaking it and winning great wealth.\r\n",
      "Day after day the ringing continued, till at last the noise became so\r\n",

      "idol of her parents. On one occasion the man was called away on\r\n",
      "business in distant Kyōto. Before he went he told his daughter that\r\n",
      "if she were good and dutiful to her mother he would bring her back\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At last he returned to his home, and after his wife and child had\r\n",
      "taken off his large hat and sandals he sat down upon the white mats\r\n",
      "and opened a bamboo basket, watching the eager gaze of his little\r\n",
      "child. He took out a wonderful doll and a lacquer box of cakes and put\r\n",
      "them into her outstretched hands. Once more he dived into his basket,\r\n",
      "and presented his wife with a metal mirror. Its convex surface shone\r\n",
      "brightly, while upon its back there was a design of pine-trees and\r\n",
      "storks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The good man's wife had never seen a mirror before, and on gazing into\r\n",
      "it she was under the impression that another woman looked out upon her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Not long after this happy home-coming and distribution of presents the\r\n",

      "her stepdaughter. But the little one, remembering her mother's last\r\n",
      "words, would retire to a corner and eagerly look into the mirror, where\r\n",
      "it seemed to her that she saw her dear mother's face, not drawn in pain\r\n",

      "For the first time her doting father grew angry, and he feared that\r\n",
      "there was, after all, truth in what his wife had told him, and he\r\n",
      "repeated her tale forthwith.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When his daughter had heard this unjust accusation she was amazed at\r\n",
      "her father's words, and she told him that she loved him far too well\r\n",
      "ever to attempt or wish to kill his wife, who she knew was dear to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What have you hidden in your sleeve?\" said her father, only hair\r\n",
      "convinced and still much puzzled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "was accomplished in the art of arranging flowers and in the art of\r\n",
      "embroidery, and that her delicate writing was not less pleasing than\r\n",

      "had been presented to him by the Goddess Benten he considered that it\r\n",
      "was unnecessary to question her in the matter. There was only one thing\r\n",

      "revealed herself to me in a vision, and said that to-morrow the husband\r\n",
      "she had chosen for my daughter would call upon me, and that I could\r\n",

      "other than his own wife! And yet there was a subtle difference, for the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Professor B. H. Chamberlain regards the \"bird-rest\" etymology and\r\n",
      "the theories derived from it as erroneous, and believes that the\r\n",
      "_torii_ came originally from Asia. He writes, in _Things Japanese_:\r\n",
      "\"The Koreans erect somewhat similar gateways at the approach of their\r\n",

      "of male or female worthies, seem related in shape as well as in use;\r\n",
      "and the occurrence of the word _turan_ in Northern India and of the\r\n",
      "word _tori_ in Central India, to denote gateways of strikingly cognate\r\n",
      "appearance, gives matter for reflection.\" Dr. W. G. Aston also believes\r\n",
      "that the _torii_ came from abroad, \"but holds that it was fitted with\r\n",
      "a pre-existing name, which would have originally designated 'a lintel'\r\n",
      "before it came to have its present sacred associations.\"[2]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In regard to the construction of these gateways, Mrs. C. M. Salwey\r\n",
      "writes: \"The oldest _torii_ of Japan ... were constructed of plain\r\n",
      "unvarnished wood. In fact, they were built of straight, upright trunks\r\n",
      "of trees in their natural state, though sometimes bereft of the outer\r\n",
      "bark. Later on the wood was painted a deep, rich vermilion, possibly\r\n",
      "to heighten the effect when the background was densely wooded.\" Though\r\n",
      "the _torii_ was originally associated with Shintōism, it was later\r\n",
      "on adopted by the Buddhists, who considerably altered its simple but\r\n",
      "beautiful construction by turning up the corners of the horizontal\r\n",
      "beams, supplying inscriptions and ornaments of various kinds.\r\n",

      "Whatever the origin and significance of the Shintō _torii_ may be, no\r\n",
      "one will deny its exquisite beauty, and many will agree in believing it\r\n",
      "to be the most perfect gateway in the world. Perhaps the most wonderful\r\n",

      "trembled violently, for he saw the face of a dead woman, a woman long\r\n",
      "dead. There was no flesh on her fingers, for what had once been fingers\r\n",
      "were now a bunch of jangling bones. Only the upper part of her body had\r\n",
      "substance; below her waist there was but a dim, moving shadow. While\r\n",

      "figure sprang up from within the room. She made for the chink and for\r\n",

      "with him from China a millstone and some seeds of the tea-plant, and\r\n",
      "thus revived the drinking of this beverage, which had fallen into\r\n",
      "disuse. We are also told in the same poem that it was Kōbō Daishi who\r\n",
      "\"demonstrated to the world the use of coal.\" He was renowned as a\r\n",

      "with him. His conception was miraculous, for when he was born in the\r\n",
      "Baron's Hall, on the shore of Byōbu, a bright light shone, and he came\r\n",
      "into the world with his hands folded as if in prayer. When but five\r\n",
      "years of age he would sit among the lotuses and converse with Buddhas,\r\n",
      "and he kept secret all the wisdom he thus obtained. His heart was\r\n",
      "troubled by the sorrow and pain of humanity. While on Mount Shashin he\r\n",
      "sought to sacrifice his own life by way of propitiation, but he was\r\n",
      "prevented from doing so by a number of angels who would not allow this\r\n",
      "ardent soul to suffer death until he had fulfilled his destiny. His\r\n",
      "very games were of a religious nature. On one occasion he built a clay\r\n",
      "pagoda, and he was immediately surrounded by the Four Heavenly Kings\r\n",
      "(originally Hindu deities). The Imperial Messenger, who happened to\r\n",
      "pass by when this miracle took place, was utterly amazed, and described\r\n",
      "the young Kōbō Daishi as \"a divine prodigy.\" While at Muroto, in Tosa,\r\n",
      "performing his devotions, we are told in the _Namu-daishi_ that a\r\n",
      "bright star fell from Heaven and entered his mouth, while at midnight\r\n",

      "to master it; but, nothing daunted, he received permission from the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Kōbō Daishi readily complied. Once again his brush moved, and this\r\n",
      "time a poem appeared on the water, a poem written in praise of that\r\n",

      "put it in for him. No sooner had Kōbō Daishi done so than the Dragon\r\n",

      "blow--moreover, that his antagonist leapt upon his body, causing him\r\n",
      "considerable pain. Momoye awoke, and cried aloud in his agony, and as\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nichiren was the founder of the Buddhist sect which bears his name. His\r\n",
      "name means Sun Lotus, and was given to him because his mother dreamt\r\n",
      "that the sun rested on a lotus when she conceived him. Nichiren was\r\n",
      "an iconoclast of very marked character. He received, by revelation, a\r\n",
      "complete knowledge of Buddhist mysteries, though in reading the story\r\n",
      "of his life one would have supposed that he acquired his remarkable\r\n",
      "religious wisdom through arduous study. During his lifetime Japan was\r\n",
      "visited by a terrible earthquake, followed by a destructive hurricane,\r\n",
      "pestilence, and famine. So great were these calamities that men prayed\r\n",
      "to die rather than live amidst such universal misery. Nichiren saw\r\n",
      "in these great disasters the hand of Fate. He saw that religion and\r\n",
      "politics had become corrupt, and that Nature had rebelled against\r\n",
      "the numerous evils that existed at that time. Nichiren realised that\r\n",
      "Buddhism was no longer the simple teaching of the Lord Buddha. In the\r\n",
      "various Buddhist sects he had studied so diligently he found that the\r\n",
      "priests had neglected Shaka Muni (the Buddha), and worshipped Amida,\r\n",
      "a manifestation of the Lord Buddha, instead. Nor did their heresy end\r\n",
      "there, for he found that priests and people also worshipped Kwannon and\r\n",
      "other divinities. Nichiren desired to sweep these deities aside and to\r\n",
      "restore Buddhism to its old purity and singleness of purpose. He cried\r\n",
      "in one of his sermons: \"Awake, men, awake! Awake and look around you.\r\n",

      "above you: there are no two suns in the sky. Look at the earth at your\r\n",
      "feet: no two kings can rule a country.\" In other words, he implied that\r\n",
      "no one can serve two masters, and the only master he found to be worthy\r\n",
      "of service and worship was Buddha himself. With this belief he sought\r\n",
      "to replace the ordinary _mantra_, _Namu Amida Butsu_, by _Namu Myōhō\r\n",

      "escaped, however, and renewed his heated attacks upon the rival sects.\r\n",

      "decided to have the monk beheaded, and the vindictive Nichiren was\r\n",
      "finally sent to the beach of Koshigoye to be executed. While awaiting\r\n",
      "the fatal stroke Nichiren prayed to Buddha, and the sword broke as\r\n",
      "it touched his neck. Nor was this the only miracle, for immediately\r\n",
      "after the breaking of the sword a flash of lightning struck the palace\r\n",
      "at Kamakura, and a heavenly light surrounded the saintly Nichiren.\r\n",
      "The official entrusted with the deed of execution was considerably\r\n",
      "impressed by these supernatural events, and he sent a messenger, to the\r\n",

      "Yone Noguchi only illustrates one phase of the Japanese fan, the phase\r\n",
      "with which we are familiar in our own country. The Japanese fan is not\r\n",
      "merely a dainty feminine trifle to be used in conjunction with a smile\r\n",
      "or with eyes peeping behind some exquisite floral design. Nippon's fan\r\n",
      "has a fascinating history quite outside the gentle art of coquetry, and\r\n",
      "those who are interested in this subject would do well to consult Mrs.\r\n",
      "C. M. Salwey's _Fans of Japan_. Here the reader will find that the fan\r\n",
      "of the Land of the Rising Sun has performed many important offices.\r\n",
      "It has been used by ancient warriors on the battlefield as a means of\r\n",
      "giving emphasis to their commands. On one occasion it was the mark of\r\n",
      "Nasu no Yoichi's bow, and although the sun-marked fan was whirling in\r\n",

      "One of the most important parts of the Japanese fan, as of any other,\r\n",
      "is the rivet, and concerning the rivet there is the following legend.\r\n",
      "Kashima on one occasion stuck his sword through the earth, with the\r\n",
      "idea of steadying the world and thus preventing earthquakes, phenomena\r\n",
      "still prevalent in Japan. Eventually the sword turned into stones, and\r\n",

      "Many of the following stories are the tales a Japanese mother narrates\r\n",
      "to her child, for animal stories make a universal appeal to the\r\n",

      "contain so much legendary material that it is necessary to include\r\n",
      "them in a book of this kind, for they tend to illustrate our subject\r\n",
      "in a lighter vein, where the miraculous is mingled with the humorous.\r\n",
      "We have devoted a separate chapter to fox legends on account of the\r\n",
      "importance of the subject, but it must be borne in mind that the\r\n",
      "supernatural characteristics of this animal apply also to the badger\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The hare is supposed to attain, like the fox, tortoise, crane, and\r\n",

      "he might appease the hunger of Indra, who drew the animal upon the moon\r\n",
      "by way of showing his admiration. The fur of the hare becomes white\r\n",

      "The White Hare of Inaba\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In ancient days there were eighty-one brothers, who were Princes in\r\n",
      "Japan. With the exception of one brother they were quarrelsome fellows,\r\n",
      "and spent their time in showing all manner of petty jealousy, one\r\n",
      "toward the other. Each wanted to reign over the whole kingdom, and,\r\n",
      "in addition, each had the misfortune to wish to marry the Princess of\r\n",
      "Yakami, in Inaba. Although these eighty Princes were at variance in\r\n",
      "most things, they were at one in persistently hating the brother who\r\n",
      "was gentle and peaceful in all his ways.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length, after many angry words, the eighty brothers decided to go\r\n",
      "to Inaba in order to visit the Princess of Yakami, each brother fully\r\n",
      "resolved that he and he alone should be the successful suitor. The kind\r\n",
      "and gentle brother accompanied them, not, indeed, as a wooer of the\r\n",
      "fair Princess, but as a servant who carried a large and heavy bag upon\r\n",
      "his back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the eighty Princes, who had left their much-wronged brother far\r\n",
      "behind, arrived at Cape Keta. They were about to continue their journey\r\n",
      "when they saw a white hare lying on the ground looking very miserable\r\n",
      "and entirely divested of fur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The eighty Princes, who were much amused by the sorry plight of the\r\n",
      "hare, said: \"If you want your fur to grow again, bathe in the sea,\r\n",
      "and, when you have done so, run to the summit of a high mountain and\r\n",
      "allow the wind to blow upon you.\" With these words the eighty heartless\r\n",
      "Princes proceeded on their way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hare at once went down to the sea, delighted at the prospect of\r\n",
      "regaining his handsome white fur. Having bathed, he ran up to the top\r\n",
      "of a mountain and lay down upon it; but he quickly perceived that\r\n",
      "the cold wind blowing on a skin recently immersed in salt water was\r\n",
      "beginning to crack and split. In addition to the humiliation of having\r\n",
      "no fur he now suffered considerable physical pain, and he realised that\r\n",
      "the eighty Princes had shamefully deceived him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the hare was lying in pain upon the mountain the kind and gentle\r\n",
      "brother approached, slowly and laboriously, owing to the heavy bag he\r\n",
      "carried. When he saw the weeping hare he inquired how it was that the\r\n",
      "poor animal had met with such a misfortune.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Please stop a moment,\" said the hare, \"and I will tell you how it\r\n",
      "all happened. I wanted to cross from the Island of Oki to Cape Keta,\r\n",
      "so I said to the crocodiles: 'I should very much like to know how\r\n",
      "many crocodiles there are in the sea, and how many hares on land.\r\n",
      "Allow me first of all to count you.' And having said these words the\r\n",
      "crocodiles formed themselves into a long line, stretching from the\r\n",
      "Island of Oki to Cape Keta. I ran across their horny bodies, counting\r\n",
      "each as I passed. When I reached the last crocodile, I said: 'O foolish\r\n",
      "crocodiles, it doesn't matter to me how many there are of you in the\r\n",
      "sea, or how many hares on land! I only wanted you for a bridge in order\r\n",
      "that I might reach my destination.' Alas! my miserable boast cost me\r\n",
      "dear, for the last crocodile raised his head and snapped off all my\r\n",
      "fur!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said the gentle brother, \"I must say you were in the wrong and\r\n",
      "deserved to suffer for your folly. Is that the end of your story?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" continued the hare. \"I had no sooner suffered this indignity than\r\n",
      "the eighty Princes came by, and lyingly told me that I might be cured\r\n",
      "by salt water and wind. Alas! not knowing that they deceived me, I\r\n",
      "carried out their instructions, with the result that my body is cracked\r\n",
      "and extremely sore.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bathe in fresh water, my poor friend,\" said the good brother, \"and\r\n",
      "when you have done so scatter the pollen of sedges upon the ground and\r\n",
      "roll yourself in it. This will indeed heal your sores and cause your\r\n",
      "fur to grow again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hare walked slowly to the river, bathed himself, and then rolled\r\n",
      "about in sedge pollen. He had no sooner done so than his skin healed\r\n",
      "and he was covered once more with a thick coat of fur.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grateful hare ran back to his benefactor. \"Those eighty wicked and\r\n",
      "cruel brothers of yours,\" said he, \"shall never win the Princess of\r\n",
      "Inaba. It is you who shall marry her and reign over the country.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The hare's prophecy came true, for the eighty Princes failed in their\r\n",
      "mission, while the brother who was good and kind to the white hare\r\n",
      "married the fair Princess and became King of the country.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Crackling Mountain\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An old man and his wife kept a white hare. One day a badger came and\r\n",
      "ate the food provided for the pet. The mischievous animal was about to\r\n",
      "scamper away when the old man, seeing what had taken place, tied the\r\n",
      "badger to a tree, and then went to a neighbouring mountain to cut wood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the old man had gone on his journey the badger began to weep and\r\n",
      "to beg that the old woman would untie the rope. She had no sooner done\r\n",
      "so than the badger proclaimed vengeance and ran away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the good white hare heard what had taken place he set out to warn\r\n",
      "his master; but during his absence the badger returned, killed the old\r\n",
      "woman, assumed her form, and converted her corpse into broth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have made such excellent broth,\" said the badger, when the old man\r\n",
      "returned from the mountain. \"You must be hungry and tired: pray sit\r\n",
      "down and make a good meal!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man, not suspecting treachery of any kind, consumed the broth\r\n",
      "and pronounced it excellent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Excellent?\" sneered the badger. \"You have eaten your wife! Her bones\r\n",
      "lie over there in that corner,\" and with these words he disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the old man was overcome with sorrow, and while he wept and\r\n",
      "bewailed his fate, the hare returned, grasped the situation, and\r\n",
      "scampered off to the mountain fully resolved to avenge the death of his\r\n",
      "poor old mistress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the hare reached the mountain he saw the badger carrying a bundle\r\n",
      "of sticks on his back. Softly the hare crept up, and, unobserved, set\r\n",
      "light to the sticks, which began to crackle immediately.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is a strange noise,\" said the badger. \"What is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The Crackling Mountain,\" replied the hare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fire began to burn the badger, so he sprang into a river and\r\n",
      "extinguished the flames; but on getting out again he found that his\r\n",
      "back was severely burnt, and the pain he suffered was increased by a\r\n",
      "cayenne poultice which the delighted hare provided for that purpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the badger was well again he chanced to see the hare standing by a\r\n",
      "boat he had made.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where are you going in that vessel?\" inquired the badger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To the moon,\" replied the hare. \"Perhaps you would like to come with\r\n",
      "me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not in your boat!\" said the badger. \"I know too well your tricks on\r\n",
      "the Crackling Mountain. But I will build a boat of clay for myself, and\r\n",
      "we will journey to the moon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Down the river went the wooden boat of the hare and the clay boat of\r\n",
      "the badger. Presently the badger's vessel began to come to pieces. The\r\n",
      "hare laughed derisively, and killed his enemy with his oar. Later on,\r\n",
      "when the loyal animal returned to the old man, he justly received much\r\n",
      "praise and loving care from his grateful master.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Badger\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The badger in legend has much in common with the fox. It can adopt\r\n",
      "human form and assume the shape of the moon; but in many legends it\r\n",
      "is described as a humorous creature, an animal intensely fond of a\r\n",
      "practical joke. The badger is frequently depicted in legend and art as\r\n",
      "playing a tattoo on its protuberant and drum-like stomach, and it is\r\n",
      "for this reason that Japanese jesters are sometimes called badgers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kadzutoyo and the Badger\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On one occasion Kadzutoyo and his retainer went fishing. They had had\r\n",
      "excellent sport, and were about to return home, when a violent shower\r\n",
      "came on, and they were forced to take shelter under a willow-tree.\r\n",
      "After waiting for some time the rain showed no sign of abating, and as\r\n",
      "it was already growing dark they decided to continue their journey in\r\n",
      "spite of the inclement weather. They had not proceeded far when they\r\n",
      "perceived a young girl weeping bitterly. Kadzutoyo regarded her with\r\n",
      "suspicion, but his retainer was charmed by the maiden's great beauty,\r\n",
      "and inquired who she was and why she lingered on such a stormy night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alas! good sir,\" said the maiden, still weeping, \"my tale is a\r\n",
      "sad one. I have long endured the taunts and cruelties of my wicked\r\n",
      "stepmother, who hates me. To-night she spat upon me and beat me. I\r\n",
      "could bear the bitter humiliation no longer, and I was on the way\r\n",
      "to my aunt, who lives in yonder village, there to receive peace and\r\n",
      "shelter, when I was stricken down with a strange malady, and compelled\r\n",
      "to remain here until the pain subsided.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These words much affected the kind-hearted retainer, and he fell\r\n",
      "desperately in love with this fair maiden; but Kadzutoyo, after\r\n",
      "carefully considering the matter, drew his sword and cut off her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! my lord,\" said the retainer, \"what awful deed is this? How can you\r\n",
      "kill a harmless girl? Believe me, you will have to pay for your folly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You do not understand,\" replied Kadzutoyo, \"but all I ask is that you\r\n",
      "keep silence in the matter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When they reached home Kadzutoyo soon fell asleep; but his retainer,\r\n",
      "after brooding over the murder of the fair maiden, went to his lord's\r\n",
      "parents and told them the whole pitiful story.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kadzutoyo's father was stricken with anger when he heard the dreadful\r\n",
      "tale. He at once went to his son's room, roused him, and said: \"Oh,\r\n",
      "miserable murderer! How could you slay an innocent girl without the\r\n",
      "least provocation? You have shamed the honourable name of _samurai_, a\r\n",
      "name that stands for true chivalry and for the defence of the weak and\r\n",
      "helpless. You have brought dishonour upon our house, and it is my duty\r\n",
      "to take your life.\" Having said these words, he drew his sword.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir,\" replied Kadzutoyo, without flinching at the shining weapon,\r\n",
      "\"you, like my retainer, do not understand. It has been given me to\r\n",
      "solve certain mysteries, and with that knowledge I assure you that I\r\n",
      "have not been guilty of so foul a crime as you suppose, but have been\r\n",
      "loyal to the fair calling of a _samurai_. The girl I cut down with my\r\n",
      "sword was no mortal. Be pleased to go to-morrow with your retainers to\r\n",
      "the spot where this scene occurred. If you find the corpse of a girl\r\n",
      "you will have no need to take my life, for I will disembowel myself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Early next day, when the sun had scarce risen in the sky, Kadzutoyo's\r\n",
      "father, together with his retainers, set out upon the journey. When\r\n",
      "they reached the place where the tragedy had taken place the father\r\n",
      "saw lying by the roadside, not the corpse of a fair maiden as he had\r\n",
      "feared, but the body of a great headless badger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the father reached home again he questioned his son: \"How is it,\"\r\n",
      "said he, \"that what appeared to be a girl to your retainer seemed to\r\n",
      "you to be a badger?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sir,\" replied Kadzutoyo, \"the creature I saw last night appeared to\r\n",
      "me as a girl; but her beauty was strange, and not like the beauty of\r\n",
      "earthly women. Moreover, although it was raining hard, I observed that\r\n",
      "the garments of this being did not get wet, and having noticed this\r\n",
      "weird occurrence, I knew at once that the woman was none other than\r\n",
      "some wicked goblin. The creature took the form of a lovely maiden with\r\n",
      "the idea of bewitching us with her many charms, in the hope that she\r\n",
      "might get our fish.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old Prince was filled with admiration for his son's cleverness.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The Miraculous Tea-kettle\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day a priest of the Morinji temple put his old tea-kettle on the\r\n",
      "fire in order that he might make himself a cup of tea. No sooner had\r\n",
      "the kettle touched the fire than it suddenly changed into the head,\r\n",
      "tail, and legs of a badger. The novices of the temple were called in\r\n",
      "to see the extraordinary sight. While they gazed in utter astonishment,\r\n",
      "the badger, with the body of a kettle, rushed nimbly about the room,\r\n",
      "and finally flew into the air. Round and round the room went the merry\r\n",
      "badger, and the priests, after many efforts, succeeded in capturing the\r\n",
      "animal and thrusting it into a box.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shortly after this event had taken place a tinker called at the temple,\r\n",
      "and the priest thought it would be an excellent idea if he could induce\r\n",
      "the good man to buy his extraordinary tea-kettle. He therefore took\r\n",
      "the kettle out of its box, for it had now resumed its ordinary form,\r\n",
      "and commenced to bargain, with the result that the unsuspecting tinker\r\n",
      "purchased the kettle, and took it away with him, assured that he had\r\n",
      "done a good day's work in buying such a useful article at so reasonable\r\n",
      "a price.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night the tinker was awakened by hearing a curious sound close\r\n",
      "to his pillow. He looked out from behind his quilts and saw that the\r\n",
      "kettle he had purchased was not a kettle at all, but a very lively and\r\n",
      "clever badger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the tinker told his friends about his remarkable companion,\r\n",
      "they said: \"You are a fortunate fellow, and we advise you to take\r\n",

      "the tight-rope. With song and music you certainly have in this very\r\n",
      "strange creature a series of novel entertainments which will attract\r\n",

      "seem to be under a curse, and for the most part they are left to their\r\n",

      "it was not long before he became dangerously ill. Physicians were\r\n",
      "summoned, but they could do nothing to restore the royal patient. It\r\n",
      "was observed that he suffered most during the night, and was troubled\r\n",

      "engaged in his supplications, he heard a strange noise proceeding from\r\n",
      "the garden. On looking out of the window he saw a young soldier washing\r\n",
      "himself. When he had finished his ablutions he stood before an image of\r\n",

      "would be able to keep off approaching drowsiness. By ten o'clock all\r\n",
      "the retainers, in spite of their efforts, had fallen asleep. Ito Soda\r\n",
      "tried to keep his eyes open, but a heaviness was gradually overcoming\r\n",
      "him, and he realised that if he wished to keep awake he must resort to\r\n",
      "extreme measures. When he had carefully spread oil-paper over the mats\r\n",
      "he stuck his dirk into his thigh. The sharp pain he experienced warded\r\n",
      "off sleep for a time, but eventually he felt his eyes closing once\r\n",
      "more. Resolved to outwit the spell which had proved too much for the\r\n",
      "retainers, he twisted the knife in his thigh, and thus increased the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "While Ito Soda watched he saw the sliding doors drawn open and a\r\n",
      "beautiful woman creep softly into the apartment. With a smile she\r\n",
      "noticed the sleeping retainers, and was about to approach the Prince\r\n",
      "when she observed Ito Soda. After she had spoken curtly to him she\r\n",
      "approached the Prince and inquired how he fared, but the Prince was\r\n",
      "too ill to make a reply. Ito Soda watched every movement, and believed\r\n",
      "she tried to bewitch the Prince, but she was always frustrated in her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In the morning the retainers awoke, and were filled with shame when\r\n",

      "praised the young soldier for his loyalty and enterprise, and he was\r\n",
      "commanded to keep watch again that night. He did so, and once more the\r\n",
      "false O Toyo entered the sick-room, and, as on the previous night, she\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was discovered that immediately the faithful Soda had kept guard\r\n",
      "the Prince was able to obtain peaceful slumber, and, moreover, that\r\n",

      "on two occasions, now kept away altogether, and the guard was not\r\n",
      "troubled with mysterious drowsiness. Soda, impressed by these strange\r\n",

      "The false O Toyo seized a halberd and endeavoured to strike her\r\n",

      "serve her better than battle she threw away her weapon, and in a moment\r\n",
      "the lovely maiden turned into a cat and sprang on to the roof. The\r\n",
      "eight men waiting outside in case of emergency shot at the animal, but\r\n",
      "the creature succeeded in eluding them.\r\n",

      "of the trouble.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Alas!\" said those who thronged about the knight, \"well may you ask why\r\n",

      "shrines, where he prayed and asked the blessings of the deities. At\r\n",

      "days were numbered, and that he would probably only have strength to\r\n",
      "pay one more visit to the great shrines at Ise. When the people of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Kanshiro set off upon his pilgrimage carrying the money in a bag, which\r\n",
      "he hung round his neck. The weather was extremely hot, and the heat\r\n",
      "and fatigue of the journey made the old man so ill that he was forced\r\n",
      "to remain for a few days in the village of Myojo. He went to a small\r\n",
      "inn and asked Jimpachi, the innkeeper, to take care of his money,\r\n",
      "explaining that it was an offering to the Gods at Ise. Jimpachi took\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On the sixth day the old man, though still far from well, paid his\r\n",

      "As Kanshiro observed many pilgrims in the vicinity he did not look\r\n",
      "into the bag, but carefully concealed it in the sack containing spare\r\n",
      "raiment and food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Kanshiro at length rested under a pine-tree he took out the bag\r\n",
      "and looked inside. Alas! the money had been stolen, and stones of the\r\n",
      "same weight inserted in its place. The old man hastily returned to the\r\n",
      "innkeeper and begged him to restore the money. Jimpachi grew extremely\r\n",
      "angry, and gave him a severe beating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The poor old man crawled away from the village, and three days later,\r\n",

      "Three years later Kanshiro went to the village of Myoto, and found\r\n",
      "that the innkeeper who had treated him so badly was now comparatively\r\n",
      "well off, and lived in a large house. The old man went to him, and\r\n",
      "said: \"You have stolen sacred money from me, and I have sold my little\r\n",
      "property in order that I might refund it to those who had given it to\r\n",
      "me. Ever since that time I have been a beggar, but be assured vengeance\r\n",
      "shall fall upon you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jimpachi cursed the old man and told him that he had not stolen his\r\n",

      "him away from the house, and told him that he would be arrested if he\r\n",
      "dared to return. At the end of the village the old man died, and a\r\n",
      "kindly priest took his body to a temple, respectfully burnt it, and\r\n",
      "offered up many holy prayers for his good and loyal soul.\r\n",

      "out of the farmer's tomb and surrounded Jimpachi's mosquito-curtain,\r\n",
      "and tried to break it down. Many of the villagers came to Jimpachi's\r\n",
      "assistance and killed a number of fireflies, but the stream of shining\r\n",
      "insects that flew from Kanshiro's tomb never lessened. Hundreds were\r\n",
      "killed, but thousands came to take their place. The room was ablaze\r\n",
      "with firefly light, and the mosquito-curtain sank beneath their\r\n",
      "ever-increasing weight. At this remarkable sight some of the villagers\r\n",

      "stimulant over which ladies are wont to gossip with their neighbours.\r\n",
      "There is nothing romantic about our tea-pots and kettles and spoons;\r\n",
      "they come from the kitchen and are returned to the kitchen with\r\n",
      "prescribed regularity. We have a few stock comments on the subject\r\n",
      "of tea, and can quote the exact price our grandmothers paid for this\r\n",
      "beverage. We have our opinions as to whether it is best taken with or\r\n",
      "without sugar, and have sometimes found it efficacious in driving away\r\n",
      "a headache.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When tea reached our own country in 1650 it was referred to as \"that\r\n",
      "excellent and by all physicians approved China drink, called by the\r\n",
      "Chineans Tcha, and by other nations Tay, alias Tee.\" In 1711 the\r\n",
      "_Spectator_ remarked: \"I would therefore in a particular manner\r\n",

      "set apart an hour every morning for tea, bread and butter; and\r\n",
      "would earnestly advise them for their good to order this paper\r\n",

      "there is no romance, no old tradition associated with our tea-drinking\r\n",

      "and numerous observances. A cup of Japanese tea is combined with\r\n",
      "spiritual and artistic enlightenment. But before discussing these very\r\n",
      "interesting ceremonies we must learn something about the significance\r\n",
      "of tea in China, for it was the drinking of this beverage in the\r\n",

      "The tea-plant, a native of Southern China, was originally regarded as\r\n",
      "a medicine. It was referred to in the classics by such names as _Tou,\r\n",
      "Tseh, Chung, Kha_, and _Ming_, and was much esteemed on account of\r\n",
      "its medicinal properties. It was regarded as an excellent lotion for\r\n",
      "strengthening the eyes, and, moreover, had the power to banish fatigue,\r\n",
      "strengthen the will, and delight the soul. It was sometimes made in\r\n",
      "the form of a paste, and was believed to be efficacious in reducing\r\n",
      "rheumatic pain. The Taoists went so far as to claim that tea was one of\r\n",
      "the ingredients of the Elixir of Life, while the Buddhist priests drank\r\n",
      "it whenever it was necessary for them to meditate during the long hours\r\n",

      "In the fourth and fifth centuries we find that tea became a highly\r\n",
      "favoured beverage among the people of the Yangtse-Kiang valley. At\r\n",
      "this time, too, poets waxed eloquent in its praise, and described it\r\n",
      "as the \"froth of the liquid jade.\" But tea at that time was a very\r\n",
      "horrible concoction indeed, for it was boiled with rice, salt, ginger,\r\n",
      "orange-peel, and not infrequently with onions! However, Luwuh, who\r\n",
      "lived in the eighth century, discountenanced the strange mixture we\r\n",
      "have just referred to. He was the first Chinese tea-master, and not\r\n",
      "only did he idealize tea, but he saw, with keen poetic insight, that\r\n",
      "the ceremony of drinking it made for harmony and order in daily life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In his _Chaking_ (\"The Holy Scripture of Tea\") he describes the nature\r\n",
      "of the tea-plant, and how its leaves should be gathered and selected.\r\n",
      "He was of the opinion that the best leaves should have \"creases like\r\n",
      "the leathern boot of Tartar horsemen, curl like the dewlap of a mighty\r\n",
      "bullock, unfold like a mist rising out of a ravine, gleam like a lake\r\n",
      "touched by a zephyr, and be wet and soft like fine earth newly swept\r\n",
      "by rain.\" Luwuh describes the various utensils connected with the tea\r\n",
      "ceremony, and asserts that the green beverage should be drunk from blue\r\n",
      "porcelain cups. He discourses on the subject of the choice of water\r\n",
      "and the manner of boiling it. In poetical language he describes the\r\n",
      "three stages of boiling. He compares the little bubbles of the first\r\n",
      "boil with the eyes of fishes, the bubbles of the second boil with a\r\n",
      "fountain crowned with clustering crystal beads, and the final boil is\r\n",
      "described as resembling the surge of miniature billows. The concluding\r\n",
      "chapters of the _Chaking_ deal with the vulgar and unorthodox methods\r\n",
      "of drinking tea, and the ardent master gives a list of celebrated\r\n",
      "tea-drinkers, and enumerates the famous Chinese tea plantations.\r\n",
      "Luwuh's fascinating book was regarded as a masterpiece. He was sought\r\n",
      "after by the Emperor Taisung, attracted many disciples, and was\r\n",
      "regarded as the greatest authority on tea and tea-drinking. His fame\r\n",
      "did not die with him, for since his death Chinese tea-merchants have\r\n",
      "worshipped him as a tutelary god.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is believed that the great Buddhist saint, Dengyō Daishi, introduced\r\n",
      "tea into Japan from China in A.D. 805. In any case tea-drinking in\r\n",
      "Nippon was associated with Buddhism, and most particularly with the\r\n",
      "Zen sect, which had incorporated so many of the Taoist doctrines. The\r\n",
      "priests of this order drank tea from a single bowl before the image\r\n",
      "of Bodhi Dharma (Daruma). They did so in the spirit of reverence,\r\n",
      "and regarded the tea-drinking as a holy sacrament. It was this Zen\r\n",
      "observance, strictly of a religious nature, which finally developed\r\n",
      "into the Japanese tea ceremony.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The tea ceremonies,\" writes Professor B. H. Chamberlain, \"have\r\n",
      "undergone three transformations during the six or seven hundred years\r\n",
      "of their existence. They have passed through a medico-religious stage,\r\n",
      "a luxurious stage, and, lastly, an æsthetic stage.\" In the religious\r\n",
      "stage the Buddhist priest Eisai wrote a pamphlet entitled _The\r\n",
      "Salutary Influence of Tea-drinking_, in which he asserted that this\r\n",
      "beverage had the power to drive away evil spirits. He introduced a\r\n",
      "religious ceremonial in regard to the worship of ancestors, accompanied\r\n",
      "by the beating of drums and the burning of incense. Eisai wrote his\r\n",
      "tract with the intention of converting Minamoto-no-Sanetomo from his\r\n",
      "vicious love of the wine-cup, and endeavoured to show the superiority\r\n",
      "of the tea-plant over the juice of the grape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We find that the tea ceremonies for the time being lost their religious\r\n",
      "significance: \"The Daimyōs,\" writes Professor Chamberlain, \"who daily\r\n",
      "took part in them reclined on couches spread with tiger-skins and\r\n",
      "leopard-skins. The walls of the spacious apartments in which the\r\n",
      "guests assembled were hung, not only with Buddhist pictures, but\r\n",
      "with damask and brocade, with gold and silver vessels, and swords in\r\n",
      "splendid sheaths. Precious perfumes were burnt, rare fishes and strange\r\n",
      "birds were served up with sweetmeats and wine, and the point of the\r\n",
      "entertainment consisted in guessing where the material for each cup of\r\n",
      "tea had been produced; for as many brands as possible were brought in,\r\n",
      "to serve as a puzzle or _jeu de société_.... Every right guess procured\r\n",
      "for him who made it the gift of one of the treasures that were hung\r\n",
      "round the room. But he was not allowed to carry it away himself. The\r\n",
      "rules of the tea ceremonies, as then practised, ordained that all the\r\n",
      "things rich and rare that were exhibited must be given by their winners\r\n",
      "to the singing and dancing-girls, troupes of whom were present to help\r\n",
      "the company in their carousal.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This variety of tea ceremony, which appears to have been more of an\r\n",
      "orgy than anything else, reflected the luxurious and dissolute age in\r\n",
      "which it was practised. The tea ceremony, in its more enduring and\r\n",
      "characteristic form, was destined to abandon all vulgar display, to\r\n",
      "embrace a certain amount of religion and philosophy, and above all to\r\n",
      "afford a means of studying art and the beauty of Nature. The tea-room\r\n",
      "became, not a place of carousal, but a place where the wayfarer might\r\n",
      "find peace in solemn meditation. Even the garden path leading to the\r\n",
      "tea-room had its symbolic meaning, for it signified the first stage of\r\n",
      "self-illumination. The following was Kobori-Enshiu's idea of the path\r\n",
      "leading to the tea-room:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     \"A cluster of summer trees,\r\n",
      "     A bit of the sea,\r\n",
      "     A pale evening moon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such a scene was intended to convey to the wayfarer a sense of\r\n",
      "spiritual light. The trees, sea, and moon awakened old dreams, and\r\n",
      "their presence made the guest eager to pass into the greater joys of\r\n",
      "the tea-room. No _samurai_ was allowed to take his sword into the\r\n",
      "fragrant sanctuary of peace, and in many tea-rooms there was a low\r\n",
      "door through which the guests entered with bowed head, as a sign of\r\n",

      "the friend of Taiko-Hideyoshi; but the age in which he lived was full\r\n",
      "of treachery. There were many who were jealous of Rikiu, many who\r\n",

      "Rikiu, the enemies of the great tea-master made use of this breach of\r\n",
      "friendship by spreading the report that Rikiu intended to add poison to\r\n",
      "a cup of tea and present it to his distinguished patron. Hideyoshi soon\r\n",
      "heard of the rumour, and without troubling to examine the matter he\r\n",
      "condemned Rikiu to die by his own hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the last day of the famous tea-master's life he invited many of his\r\n",
      "disciples to join with him in his final tea ceremony. As they walked up\r\n",

      "When the disciples entered the tea-room they saw a _kakemono_ hanging\r\n",
      "in the _tokonoma_, and when they raised their sorrowful eyes they saw\r\n",
      "that the writing described the passing of all earthly things. There\r\n",
      "was poetry in the singing of the tea-kettle, but it was a sad song\r\n",
      "like the plaintive cry of an insect. Rikiu came into the tea-room calm\r\n",
      "and dignified, and, according to custom, he allowed the chief guest to\r\n",
      "admire the various articles associated with the tea ceremony. When all\r\n",
      "the guests had gazed upon them, noting their beauty with a heavy heart,\r\n",
      "Rikiu presented each disciple with a souvenir. He took his own cup in\r\n",
      "his hand, and said: \"Never again shall this cup, polluted by the lips\r\n",
      "of misfortune, be used by man.\" Having spoken these words, he broke the\r\n",
      "cup as a sign that the tea ceremony was over, and the guests bade a sad\r\n",
      "farewell and departed. Only one remained to witness, not the drinking\r\n",
      "of another cup of tea, but the passing of Rikiu. The great master took\r\n",
      "off his outer garment, and revealed the pure white robe of Death. Still\r\n",
      "calm and dignified, he looked upon his dagger, and then recited the\r\n",

      "Japan. He is said to have been the son of a Hindu king, and received\r\n",
      "instruction from Panyatara. When he had completed his studies he\r\n",
      "retired to Lo Yang, where he remained seated in meditation for nine\r\n",
      "years. During this period the sage was tempted after the manner of St.\r\n",
      "Anthony. He wrestled with these temptations by continually reciting\r\n",
      "sacred scriptures; but the frequent repetition of the word \"jewel\"\r\n",
      "lost its spiritual significance, and became associated with the\r\n",
      "precious stone worn in the ear of a certain lovely woman. Even the word\r\n",
      "\"lotus,\" so sacred to all true Buddhists, ceased to be the symbol of\r\n",

      "mouth. His temptations increased, and he was transported to an Indian\r\n",
      "city, where he found himself among a vast crowd of worshippers. He saw\r\n",
      "strange deities with horrible symbols upon their foreheads, and Rajahs\r\n",
      "and Princes riding upon elephants, surrounded by a great company of\r\n",
      "dancing-girls. The great crowd of people surged forward, and Daruma\r\n",

      "temple covered with a multitude of foul forms, and it seemed to Daruma\r\n",
      "that he met and kissed the woman who had changed the meaning of jewel\r\n",
      "and lotus. Then suddenly the vision departed, and Daruma awoke to\r\n",

      "asleep during his meditation, was truly penitent for the neglect of his\r\n",

      "the noise of warfare. In order to pacify the unfortunate spirits the\r\n",
      "temple of Amidaji was built at Akamagaséki, and a cemetery was made\r\n",

      "cemetery pacified the ghostly visitants to a certain extent, but from\r\n",
      "time to time many strange things happened, as we shall gather from the\r\n",
      "following legend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There once lived at the Amidaji temple a blind priest named Hōïchi. He\r\n",
      "was famous for his recitation and for his marvellous skill in playing\r\n",
      "upon the _biwa_ (a four-stringed lute), and he was particularly fond\r\n",
      "of reciting stories in connection with the protracted war between the\r\n",
      "Taira and Minamoto clans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night Hōïchi was left alone in the temple, and as it was a very\r\n",
      "warm evening he sat out on the verandah, playing now and again upon\r\n",
      "his _biwa_. While thus occupied he heard some one approaching, some\r\n",
      "one stepping across the little back garden of the temple. Then a deep\r\n",
      "voice cried out from below the verandah: \"Hōïchi!\" Yet again the voice\r\n",
      "sounded: \"Hōïchi!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hōïchi, now very much alarmed, replied that he was blind, and would be\r\n",
      "glad to know who his visitor might be.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My lord,\" began the stranger, \"is now staying at Akamagaséki with many\r\n",
      "noble followers, and he has come for the purpose of viewing the scene\r\n",
      "of the battle of Dan-no-ura. He has heard how excellently you recite\r\n",
      "the story of the conflict, and has commanded me to escort you to him in\r\n",
      "order that you may show him your skill. Bring your _biwa_ and follow\r\n",
      "me. My lord and his august assembly now await your honourable presence.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hōïchi, deeming that the stranger was some noble _samurai_, obeyed\r\n",
      "immediately. He donned his sandals and took his _biwa_. The stranger\r\n",
      "guided him with an iron hand, and they marched along very quickly.\r\n",
      "Hōïchi heard the clank of armour at his side; but all fear left him,\r\n",
      "and he looked forward to the honour of showing his skill before a\r\n",
      "distinguished company.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arriving at a gate, the stranger shouted: \"_Kaimon_!\" Immediately the\r\n",
      "gate was unbarred and opened, and the two men passed in. Then came\r\n",
      "the sound of many hurrying feet, and a rustling noise as of screens\r\n",
      "being opened. Hōïchi was assisted in mounting a number of steps,\r\n",
      "and, arriving at the top, he was commanded to leave his sandals. A\r\n",
      "woman then led him forward by the hand till he found himself in a\r\n",
      "vast apartment, where he judged that a great company of people were\r\n",
      "assembled. He heard the subdued murmur of voices and the soft movement\r\n",
      "of silken garments. When Hōïchi had seated himself on a cushion the\r\n",
      "woman who had led him bade him recite the story of the great battle of\r\n",
      "Dan-no-ura.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hōïchi began to chant to the accompaniment of his _biwa_. His skill\r\n",
      "was so great that the strings of his instrument seemed to imitate the\r\n",
      "sound of oars, the movement of ships, the shouting of men, the noise\r\n",
      "of surging waves, and the whirring of arrows. A low murmur of applause\r\n",
      "greeted Hōïchi's wonderful performance. Thus encouraged, he continued\r\n",
      "to sing and play with even greater skill. When he came to chant of the\r\n",
      "perishing of the women and children, the plunge of Niidono into the sea\r\n",
      "with the infant Emperor in her arms, the company began to weep and wail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the performance was over the woman who had led Hōïchi told him\r\n",
      "that her lord was well pleased with his skill, and that he desired him\r\n",
      "to play before him for the six following nights. \"The retainer,\" added\r\n",
      "she, \"who brought you to-night will visit your temple at the same hour\r\n",
      "to-morrow. You must keep these visits secret, and may now return to\r\n",
      "your abode.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more the woman led Hōïchi through the apartment, and having\r\n",
      "reached the steps the same retainer led him back to the verandah at the\r\n",
      "back of the temple where he lived.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next night Hōïchi was again led forth to entertain the assembly,\r\n",
      "and he met with the same success. But this time his absence was\r\n",
      "detected, and upon his return his fellow priest questioned him in\r\n",
      "regard to the matter. Hōïchi evaded his friend's question, and told him\r\n",
      "that he had merely been out to attend some private business.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His questioner was by no means satisfied. He regretted Hōïchi's\r\n",
      "reticence and feared that there was something wrong, possibly that,\r\n",
      "the blind priest had been bewitched by evil spirits. He bade the\r\n",
      "men-servants keep a strict watch upon Hōïchi, and to follow him if he\r\n",
      "should again leave the temple during the night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more Hōïchi left his abode. The men-servants hastily lit their\r\n",
      "lanterns and followed him with all speed; but though they walked\r\n",
      "quickly, looked everywhere, and made numerous inquiries, they failed\r\n",
      "to discover Hōïchi, or learn anything concerning him. On their\r\n",
      "return, however, they were alarmed to hear the sound of a _biwa_ in\r\n",
      "the cemetery of the temple, and on entering this gloomy place they\r\n",
      "discovered the blind priest. He sat at the tomb of Antoku Tenno, the\r\n",
      "infant Emperor, where he twanged his _biwa_ loudly, and as loudly\r\n",
      "chanted the story of the battle of Dan-no-ura. About him on every side\r\n",
      "mysterious fires glowed, like a great gathering of lighted candles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hōïchi! Hōïchi!\" shouted the men. \"Stop your playing at once! You are\r\n",
      "bewitched, Hōïchi!\" But the blind priest continued to play and sing,\r\n",
      "rapt, it seemed, in a strange and awful dream.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The men-servants now resorted to more extreme measures. They shook\r\n",
      "him, and shouted in his ear: \"Hōïchi, come back with us at once!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The blind priest rebuked them, and said that such an interruption would\r\n",
      "not be tolerated by the noble assembly about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The men now dragged Hōïchi away by force. When he reached the temple\r\n",
      "his wet clothes were taken off and food and drink set before him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time Hōïchi's fellow priest was extremely angry, and he\r\n",
      "not unjustly insisted upon a full explanation of his extraordinary\r\n",
      "behaviour. Hōïchi, after much hesitation, told his friend all that\r\n",
      "had happened to him. When he had narrated his strange adventures, the\r\n",
      "priest said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My poor fellow! You ought to have told me this before. You have not\r\n",
      "been visiting a great house of a noble lord, but you have been sitting\r\n",
      "in yonder cemetery before the tomb of Antoku Tenno. Your great skill\r\n",
      "has called forth the ghosts of the Taira clan. Hōïchi, you are in great\r\n",
      "danger, for by obeying these spirits you have assuredly put yourself in\r\n",
      "their power, and sooner or later they will kill you. Unfortunately I am\r\n",
      "called away to-night to perform a service, but before I go I will see\r\n",
      "that your body is covered with sacred texts.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Before night approached Hōïchi was stripped, and upon his body an\r\n",
      "acolyte inscribed, with writing-brushes, the text of the _sutra_ known\r\n",
      "as _Hannya-Shin-Kyō_. These texts were written upon Hōïchi's breast,\r\n",
      "head, back, face, neck, legs, arms, and feet, even upon the soles\r\n",
      "thereof.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "[Illustration: Hōïchi the Earless.--304]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the priest said: \"Hōïchi, you will be called again to-night.\r\n",
      "Remain silent, sit very still, and continually meditate. If you do\r\n",
      "these things no harm will befall you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night Hōïchi sat alone in the verandah, scarcely moving a muscle\r\n",
      "and breathing very softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more he heard the sound of footsteps. \"Hōïchi!\" cried a deep\r\n",
      "voice. But the blind priest made no answer. He sat very still, full of\r\n",
      "a great fear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His name was called over and over again, but to no effect. \"This won't\r\n",
      "do,\" growled the stranger. \"I must see where the fellow is.\" The\r\n",
      "stranger sprang into the verandah and stood beside Hōïchi, who was now\r\n",
      "shaking all over with the horror of the situation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah!\" said the stranger. \"This is the _biwa_, but in place of the\r\n",

      "has no mouth, only his two ears! Those ears I will take to my lord!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In another moment Hōïchi's ears were torn off, but in spite of the\r\n",
      "fearful pain the blind priest remained mute. Then the stranger\r\n",
      "departed, and when his footsteps had died away the only sound Hōïchi\r\n",
      "heard was the trickling of blood upon the verandah, and thus the priest\r\n",
      "found the unfortunate man upon his return.\r\n",

      "wherewithal to purchase food of any kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "pathetic way: \"Elder Brother probably is cold?\" \"Nay, thou probably art\r\n",
      "cold?\" And sobbing forth these words they clung together, afraid of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "While their poor little bodies nestled together, striving to keep each\r\n",

      "was no one to pay the rent, he turned the children out of the house,\r\n",
      "each clad only in one thin _kimono_. They tried to reach a temple\r\n",
      "of Kwannon, but the snow was too heavy, and they hid behind their\r\n",
      "old home. A _futon_ of snow covered them and they fell asleep on the\r\n",
      "merciful bosom of the Gods, and were finally buried in the cemetery of\r\n",
      "the Temple of Kwannon-of-the-Thousand-Arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the innkeeper heard this sad story he gave the _futon_ to the\r\n",
      "priests of the Kwannon temple, prayers were recited for the children's\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "and whatever that test of love may be, I expect him, on the sacred\r\n",
      "honour of a _samurai_, not to divulge it.\" The suitors readily complied\r\n",
      "with these conditions, but one by one they left her, with horror upon\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When the wooer was able to penetrate the darkness he saw that the\r\n",

      "she snatched up the corpse of a child, tore off an arm, broke it, and\r\n",

      "lies in yonder cemetery, and I, being old and feeble, must needs follow\r\n",
      "him soon. The thought of leaving you alone in the world troubles me\r\n",
      "much, for you are beautiful, and beauty is a temptation and a snare to\r\n",
      "men. Not all the purity of a white flower can prevent it from being\r\n",

      "to fall from your good and simple life to one of shame.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Shortly after this loving deed had been performed the old woman\r\n",

      "rice-fields. It was hard, weary work, but the girl kept a brave heart\r\n",
      "and toiled from dawn to sunset without a murmur. Over and over again\r\n",
      "her strange appearance created considerable comment, and she was known\r\n",

      "a few endeavoured to pull off the wooden covering; but it could not\r\n",
      "be removed, and laughing and jesting, the young men had to be content\r\n",
      "with a glimpse of the lower part of the fair maiden's face. The poor\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "One day a rich farmer watched the maiden working in his rice-fields.\r\n",
      "He was struck by her diligence and the quick and excellent way she\r\n",
      "performed her tasks. He was pleased with that bent and busy little\r\n",
      "figure, and did not laugh at the wooden bowl on her head. After\r\n",
      "observing her for some time, he came to the maiden, and said: \"You work\r\n",
      "well and do not chatter to your companions. I wish you to labour in my\r\n",
      "rice-fields until the end of the harvest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the rice harvest had been gathered and winter had come the wealthy\r\n",

      "The maiden gratefully accepted this welcome offer. She tended the sick\r\n",
      "woman with every care, for the same quiet diligence she displayed\r\n",
      "in the rice-fields was characteristic of her gentle labour in the\r\n",
      "sick-room. As the farmer and his wife had no daughter they took very\r\n",
      "kindly to this orphan and regarded her as a child of their own.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length the farmer's eldest son returned to his old home. He was a\r\n",
      "wise young man who had studied much in gay Kyōto, and was weary of a\r\n",
      "merry life of feasting and frivolous pleasure. His father and mother\r\n",
      "expected that their son would soon grow tired of his father's house and\r\n",
      "its quiet surroundings, and every day they feared that he would come to\r\n",
      "them, bid farewell, and return once more to the city of the Mikado. But\r\n",
      "to the surprise of all the farmer's son expressed no desire to leave\r\n",
      "his old home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day the young man came to his father, and said: \"Who is this maiden\r\n",
      "in our house, and why does she wear an ugly black bowl upon her head?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the farmer had told the sad story of the maiden his son was deeply\r\n",
      "moved; but, nevertheless, he could not refrain from laughing a little\r\n",
      "at the bowl. The young man's laughter, however, did not last long.\r\n",
      "Day by day the maiden became more fascinating to him. Now and again\r\n",
      "he peeped at the girl's half-hidden face, and became more and more\r\n",
      "impressed by her gentleness of manner and her nobility of nature. It\r\n",
      "was not long before his admiration turned into love, and he resolved\r\n",
      "that he would marry the Maiden with the Bowl on her Head. Most of his\r\n",
      "relations were opposed to the union. They said: \"She is all very well\r\n",
      "in her way, but she is only a common servant. She wears that bowl in\r\n",
      "order to captivate the unwary, and we do not think it hides beauty, but\r\n",
      "rather ugliness. Seek a wife elsewhere, for we will not tolerate this\r\n",
      "ambitious and scheming maiden.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From that hour the maiden suffered much. Bitter and spiteful things\r\n",
      "were said to her, and even her mistress, once so good and kind, turned\r\n",
      "against her. But the farmer did not change his opinion. He still liked\r\n",
      "the girl, and was quite willing that she should become his son's wife,\r\n",
      "but, owing to the heated remarks of his wife and relations, he dared\r\n",
      "not reveal his wishes in the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All the opposition, none too kindly expressed, only made the young\r\n",
      "man more desirous to achieve his purpose. At length his mother and\r\n",
      "relations, seeing that their wishes were useless, consented to the\r\n",
      "marriage, but with a very bad grace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man, believing that all difficulties had been removed,\r\n",
      "joyfully went to the Maiden with the Bowl on her Head, and said: \"All\r\n",
      "troublesome opposition is at an end, and now nothing prevents us from\r\n",
      "getting married.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" replied the poor maiden, weeping bitterly, \"I cannot marry you.\r\n",
      "I am only a servant in your father's house, and therefore it would be\r\n",
      "unseemly for me to become your bride.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man spoke gently to her. He expressed his ardent love over\r\n",
      "and over again, he argued, he begged; but the maiden would not change\r\n",
      "her mind. Her attitude made the relations extremely angry. They said\r\n",
      "that the woman had made fools of them all, little knowing that she\r\n",
      "dearly loved the farmer's son, and believed, in her loyal heart, that\r\n",
      "marriage could only bring discord in the home that had sheltered her in\r\n",
      "her poverty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night the poor girl cried herself to sleep, and in a dream her\r\n",
      "mother came to her, and said: \"My dear child, let your good heart be\r\n",
      "troubled no more. Marry the farmer's son and all will be well again.\"\r\n",
      "The maiden woke next morning full of joy, and when her lover came to\r\n",
      "her and asked once more if she would become his bride, she yielded with\r\n",
      "a gracious smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Great preparations were made for the wedding, and when the company\r\n",
      "assembled, it was deemed high time to remove the maiden's wooden bowl.\r\n",
      "She herself tried to take it off, but it remained firmly fixed to\r\n",
      "her head. When some of the relations, with not a few unkind remarks,\r\n",
      "came to her assistance, the bowl uttered strange cries and groans. At\r\n",
      "length the bridegroom approached the maiden, and said: \"Do not let this\r\n",
      "treatment distress you. You are just as dear to me with or without the\r\n",
      "bowl,\" and having said these words, he commanded that the ceremony\r\n",
      "should proceed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the wine-cups were brought into the crowded apartment and,\r\n",
      "according to custom, the bride and bridegroom were expected to drink\r\n",
      "together the \"Three times three\" in token of their union. Just as the\r\n",
      "maiden put the wine-cup to her lips the bowl on her head broke with\r\n",
      "a great noise, and from it fell gold and silver and all manner of\r\n",
      "precious stones, so that the maiden who had once been a beggar now had\r\n",
      "her marriage portion. The guests were amazed as they looked upon the\r\n",
      "heap of shining jewels and gold and silver, but they were still more\r\n",
      "surprised when they chanced to look up and see that the bride was the\r\n",

      "of corpse or human bones. At length, however, he perceived what looked\r\n",
      "like a sword wrapped in silk, and on untying the wrapping he found\r\n",
      "that it was indeed a sword, of great brightness and without a flaw of\r\n",
      "any kind. Sankichi came to the surface and was quickly taken aboard.\r\n",
      "The poor fellow was gently laid on the deck, but he fainted from\r\n",
      "exhaustion. His cold body was rubbed vigorously and fires were lit. In\r\n",

      "In the isolated Hatsushima Island, celebrated for its _suisenn_\r\n",
      "(jonquils), there once lived a beautiful maiden called Cho, and all the\r\n",
      "young men on the island were eager to marry her. One day the handsome\r\n",
      "Shinsaku, who was bolder than the rest, went to Gisuke, the brother\r\n",
      "of Cho, and told him that he much desired to marry his fair sister.\r\n",
      "Gisuke offered no objections, and calling Cho to him, when the suitor\r\n",
      "had gone, he said: \"Shinsaku wishes to become your husband. I like the\r\n",
      "fisherman, and think that in him you will make an excellent match. You\r\n",
      "are now eighteen, and it is quite time that you got married.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "O Cho San fully approved of what her brother had said, and the marriage\r\n",
      "was arranged to take place in three days' time. Unfortunately, those\r\n",
      "days were days of discord on the island, for when the other fishermen\r\n",
      "lovers heard the news they began to hate the once popular Shinsaku,\r\n",
      "and, moreover, they neglected their work and were continually fighting\r\n",
      "each other. These lamentable scenes cast such a gloom upon the once\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This noble sacrifice, however, did not bring about the desired effect,\r\n",
      "for the thirty lovers still fought each other and still neglected their\r\n",
      "fishing. O Cho San determined to perform a still greater sacrifice.\r\n",
      "She wrote loving letters of farewell to her brother and Shinsaku, and\r\n",
      "having left them by the sleeping Gisuke, she softly crept out of the\r\n",
      "house on a stormy night on the 10th of June. She dropped big stones\r\n",
      "into her pretty sleeves, and then flung herself into the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day Gisuke and Shinsaku read their letters from O Cho San,\r\n",
      "and, overcome by grief, they searched the shore, where they found the\r\n",
      "straw sandals of Cho. The two men realised that the fair maid had\r\n",
      "indeed taken her precious life, and shortly after her body was taken\r\n",
      "from the sea and buried, and over her tomb Shinsaku placed many flowers\r\n",
      "and wept continually.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, Shinsaku, unable to bear his sorrow any longer decided to\r\n",
      "take his life, believing that by doing so he would meet the spirit of O\r\n",
      "Cho San. As he lingered by the girl's grave, he seemed to see her white\r\n",
      "ghost, and, murmuring her name over and over again, he rushed toward\r\n",
      "her. At this moment Gisuke, awakened by the noise, came out of his\r\n",
      "house, and found Shinsaku clinging to his lover's gravestone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Shinsaku told his friend that he had seen the spirit of O Cho San,\r\n",
      "and intended to take his life in order to be with her for ever, Gisuke\r\n",
      "made answer thus: \"Shinsaku, great is your love for my poor sister, but\r\n",
      "you can love her best by serving her in this world. When the great Gods\r\n",
      "call, you will meet her, but await with hope and courage till that hour\r\n",
      "comes, for only a brave, as well as a loving, heart is worthy of O Cho\r\n",

      "The morning after a great earthquake had devastated the fishing village\r\n",
      "of Nanao, it was observed that about two miles from the shore a rock\r\n",
      "had sprung up as the result of the seismic disturbance and, moreover,\r\n",
      "that the sea had become muddy. One night a number of fishermen\r\n",
      "were passing by the rock, when they observed, near at hand, a most\r\n",
      "extraordinary light that appeared to float up from the bottom of the\r\n",
      "sea with a glory as bright as the sun. The fishermen shipped their oars\r\n",
      "and gazed upon the wonderful spectacle with considerable surprise, but\r\n",
      "when the light was suddenly accompanied by a deep rumbling sound, the\r\n",
      "sailors feared another earthquake and made all speed for Nanao.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the third day the wondrous rays from the deep increased in\r\n",
      "brilliance, so that folk standing on the shore of Nanao could see\r\n",
      "them distinctly, and the superstitious fishermen became more and more\r\n",
      "frightened. Only Kansuke and his son Matakichi had sufficient courage\r\n",
      "to go fishing. On their return journey they reached the Rock Island,\r\n",
      "and were drawing in their line when Kansuke lost his balance and fell\r\n",
      "into the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though old Kansuke was a good swimmer, he went down like a stone\r\n",
      "and did not rise to the surface. Matakichi, deeming this strange,\r\n",
      "dived into the water, almost blinded by the mysterious rays we have\r\n",
      "already described. When he at length reached the bottom he discovered\r\n",
      "innumerable _awabi_ (ear-shells), and in the middle of the group one\r\n",
      "of vast size. From all these shells there poured forth a brilliant\r\n",
      "light, and though it was like day under the water, Matakichi could\r\n",
      "find no trace of his father. Eventually he was forced to rise to the\r\n",
      "surface, only to find that the rough sea had broken his boat. However,\r\n",
      "scrambling upon a piece of wreckage, with the aid of a favourable\r\n",
      "wind and current he at last reached the shore of Nanao, and gave the\r\n",
      "villagers an account of his remarkable adventure, and of the loss of\r\n",
      "his old father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Matakichi, grieving sorely over the death of his parent, went to the\r\n",
      "old village priest and begged that worthy that he would make him one\r\n",
      "of his disciples in order that he might pray the more efficaciously\r\n",
      "for the spirit of his father. The priest readily consented, and about\r\n",
      "three weeks later they took boat to the Rock Island, where both prayed\r\n",
      "ardently for the soul of Kansuke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That night the old priest awoke with a start and saw an ancient man\r\n",
      "standing by his bedside. With a profound bow the stranger thus spoke:\r\n",
      "\"I am the Spirit of the Great Awabi, and I am more than one thousand\r\n",
      "years old. I live in the sea near the Rock Island, and this morning\r\n",
      "I heard you praying for the soul of Kansuke. Alas! good priest, your\r\n",
      "prayers have deeply moved me, but in shame and sorrow I confess that I\r\n",
      "ate Kansuke. I have bade my followers depart elsewhere, and in order to\r\n",
      "atone for my sin I shall take my own wretched life, so that the pearl\r\n",
      "that is within me may be given to Matakichi.\" And having uttered these\r\n",
      "words, the Spirit of the Great Awabi suddenly disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Matakichi awoke next morning and opened the shutters he discovered\r\n",
      "the enormous _awabi_ he had seen near the Rock Island. He took it to\r\n",
      "the old priest, who, after listening to his disciple's story, gave an\r\n",
      "account of his own experience. The great pearl and shell of the _awabi_\r\n",
      "were placed in the temple, and the body was reverently buried.\r\n",

      "Japanese Superstition\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The subject of Japanese superstition is of special importance, because\r\n",
      "it serves to indicate the channel by which many myths and legends, but\r\n",
      "more particularly folk-lore, have evolved. Superstition is, as it were,\r\n",
      "the raw material out of which innumerable strange beliefs are gradually\r\n",
      "fashioned into stories, and an inquiry into the subject will show us\r\n",
      "the peasant mind striving to counteract certain supernatural forces,\r\n",
      "or to turn them to advantage in every-day life. Many superstitions\r\n",
      "have already been recorded in these pages, and in the present chapter\r\n",
      "we shall deal with those that have not been treated elsewhere. It is\r\n",
      "scarcely necessary to point out that these superstitions, selected from\r\n",
      "a vast store of quaint beliefs, are necessarily of a primitive kind and\r\n",
      "must be regarded, excluding, perhaps, those associated with the classic\r\n",
      "art of divination, as peculiar to the more ignorant classes in Japan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Human Sacrifice\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In prehistoric times the bow was believed to possess supernatural\r\n",
      "power. It would miraculously appear on the roof of a man's house as a\r\n",
      "sign that the eldest unmarried daughter must be sacrificed. She was\r\n",
      "accordingly buried alive in order that her flesh might be consumed by\r\n",
      "the Deity of Wild Beasts. Later on, however, the bow was no longer\r\n",
      "the message of a cruel divinity, for it gradually lost its horrible\r\n",
      "significance, and has now become a symbol of security. To this day it\r\n",
      "may be seen fixed to the ridge-pole of a roof, and is regarded as a\r\n",
      "lucky charm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We have another example of human sacrifice in the old repulsive custom\r\n",
      "of burying a man alive with the idea of giving stability to a bridge\r\n",
      "or castle. In the early days, when forced labour existed, there was\r\n",
      "unfortunately scant regard for the sacredness of human life. Those\r\n",
      "who laboured without reward were under the control of a merciless\r\n",
      "superintendent, who emphasised his orders by means of a spear. He\r\n",
      "was ready to kill all those who were idle or in any way rebellious,\r\n",
      "and many corpses were flung into the masonry. When a river had to be\r\n",
      "dammed, or a fortification constructed with the utmost despatch, this\r\n",
      "deplorable deed was not unusual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When a new bridge was built its utility and long life were assured,\r\n",
      "not always by human sacrifice or sorrow, but sometimes by happiness.\r\n",
      "The first persons allowed to walk over a new bridge were those of\r\n",
      "a particularly happy disposition. We are told, that two genial old\r\n",
      "men, who each had a family of twelve children, first crossed the\r\n",
      "Matsue bridge, accompanied by their wives, children, grandchildren,\r\n",
      "and great-grandchildren. This joyous procession took place amid\r\n",
      "much rejoicing and a display of fireworks. The idea of happiness\r\n",
      "contributing to the success of a Japanese bridge is a pretty\r\n",
      "conception, but, unfortunately, the old bridge of Matsue, now replaced\r\n",
      "by one far less picturesque, is associated with a very unpleasant\r\n",
      "tradition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Horiō Yoshiharu became _Daimyō_ of Izumo he arranged to build a\r\n",
      "bridge over the turbulent river at Matsue. Many laboured to carry out\r\n",
      "his wishes, but the work did not prosper. Countless great stones were\r\n",
      "flung into the rushing water with the idea of making a solid base on\r\n",
      "which to construct the pillars, but many of the stones were washed\r\n",
      "away, and as soon as the bridge took tangible form it was wrecked by\r\n",
      "the fierce torrent. It was believed that the spirits of the flood were\r\n",
      "angry, and in order to appease them it was deemed necessary to offer a\r\n",
      "human sacrifice. A man was accordingly buried alive below the central\r\n",
      "pillar where the water was most turbulent. When this had been done the\r\n",
      "work prospered, and the bridge remained intact for three hundred years.\r\n",
      "Gensuke was the unfortunate victim, and this was the name given to the\r\n",
      "central pillar. It is said that on moonless nights a mysterious red\r\n",
      "fire shines from this pillar--the ghostly emanations of poor Gensuke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Classical Divination\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the most popular forms of Japanese superstition is associated\r\n",
      "with divination, and Confucianism has no doubt contributed much to\r\n",
      "its popularity. The _Yih-King_, or \"Book of Changes,\" is the main\r\n",
      "source of the art, and Confucius devoted so much time to the study of\r\n",
      "this mysterious work that it is said that the leathern thongs used\r\n",
      "to hold the leaves together were replaced three times during his\r\n",
      "lifetime. The _Yih-King_ was commenced by Fu Hsi two thousand years\r\n",
      "before the birth of Christ, and Confucius added much fresh material. A\r\n",
      "more complicated method of reading the future than by means of eight\r\n",
      "trigrams and sixty-four diagrams cannot be imagined. So involved a\r\n",
      "system of divination naturally became the art of the learned few, but\r\n",
      "in course of time it underwent various modifications. It lost, to a\r\n",
      "certain extent, its most classic aspect, and many Japanese diviners\r\n",
      "sprang up in the country professing to read the future for a small\r\n",
      "fee, and without the qualification of having deeply pondered over the\r\n",
      "instruction to be found in the _Yih-King_. A comparatively simple form\r\n",
      "of divination is with fifty divining rods, shuffled in a particular\r\n",
      "way, and the final position of the rods is supposed to answer the\r\n",
      "various questions of the inquirer. Many diviners in Japan to-day are\r\n",
      "mere charlatans working upon the credulity of their patrons, without\r\n",
      "fully understanding the art they practise. But in ancient times\r\n",
      "divination was associated with a sacred ritual. It was necessary for\r\n",
      "the diviner, like the old swordsmith, to prepare and fit himself for\r\n",
      "his task. It was required of him that he should thoroughly cleanse his\r\n",
      "body, seat himself in a private apartment, and go through the elaborate\r\n",
      "process of holding the rods in the spirit of reverence. At a certain\r\n",
      "moment he was instructed to close his eyes, suspend breathing for a\r\n",
      "time, and concentrate his thoughts on his work of divination, for the\r\n",
      "old diviner, like the old Shintō priest, believed that he was calling\r\n",
      "the supernatural to his aid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other Forms of Divination\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In other forms of divination, requiring no expert interpretation, we\r\n",
      "find that the future is supposed to be revealed in the cracks and\r\n",
      "lines of a slightly burnt shoulder-bone of a deer, a method which\r\n",
      "closely resembles the old English custom of \"reading the speal-bone.\"\r\n",
      "It was not always easy to secure a deer's shoulder-bone, and as the\r\n",
      "markings were of more importance than the bone itself, in course of\r\n",
      "time burnt tortoise-shell took its place. As hair-combs were usually\r\n",
      "made of this material, a woman, by charring it, was able to read the\r\n",
      "lines and ascertain the constancy or otherwise of her lover, &c. Girls\r\n",
      "used to read the riddle of the future and see what it had in store\r\n",
      "for them by going out at night and stringing together the fragmentary\r\n",
      "remarks of passers-by. This method is known as _tsuji-ura_, but it is\r\n",
      "by no means peculiar to Japan, for it is still frequently practised by\r\n",
      "superstitious people in our own country. A love-sick maiden tried to\r\n",
      "discover whether or not her love would be requited by placing a rod in\r\n",
      "the ground, surrounding it with various offerings, and listening to the\r\n",
      "conversation of wayfarers who chanced to come that way.[1] A later and\r\n",
      "more elaborate development of this form of divination required three\r\n",
      "maidens, and the method employed is as follows. The young women went to\r\n",
      "where roads crossed each other, and thrice repeated an invocation to\r\n",
      "the God of Roads. When they had supplicated this Deity, they flung rice\r\n",
      "on the ground, for rice has the power of driving away evil spirits. The\r\n",
      "maidens then rubbed their fingers against the teeth of a boxwood comb,\r\n",
      "because _tsuge_, the Japanese name for this wood, also means \"to tell.\"\r\n",
      "After these preparations they each stood in a different position and\r\n",
      "pieced together the remarks of passers-by. Occasionally some message\r\n",
      "from the future was received while the inquirer stood under a bridge\r\n",
      "and listened to the clatter of feet, and sometimes a priest whistling\r\n",
      "by inhalation was supposed to reveal an omen of some kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Unlucky Years and Days\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is believed that certain periods of life are extremely unlucky. The\r\n",
      "twenty-fifth, forty-second, and sixty-first years of a man's life are\r\n",
      "considered unfortunate, while the unlucky years of a woman's life are\r\n",
      "the nineteenth, thirty-third, and thirty-seventh. In order to prevent\r\n",
      "calamity during these periods, it is necessary to devote much time to\r\n",
      "religious exercises. Men and women are advised not to take a journey\r\n",
      "during the sixteenth, twenty-fifth, thirty-fourth, forty-third,\r\n",
      "fifty-second, and sixty-first year. When superstitious women wish to\r\n",
      "make a new garment, they utter an invocation, and later on sprinkle\r\n",
      "three pinches of salt on the shoulder gusset. No woman should use her\r\n",
      "needle on a \"monkey\" day, but rather on a \"bird\" day. If the work is\r\n",
      "undertaken on the former day, the garment is in danger of being burnt\r\n",
      "or rent; but if the apparel is made on the latter day, it will have the\r\n",
      "beauty and durability of the feathers of a bird.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Children\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When a child's tooth falls out, it is thrown away under the eaves, with\r\n",
      "the wish that it may be replaced by the tooth of a demon. Sometimes the\r\n",
      "tooth of a little boy or girl is thrown on the floor with the request\r\n",
      "that it may be replaced by the tooth of a rat. Children may be immune\r\n",
      "from nightmare if the word \"puppy\" is written on their foreheads; and\r\n",
      "if to this precaution is added a sketch of the _Baku_, Eater of Dreams,\r\n",
      "the little one's slumber will be sure to be of a peaceful kind. The\r\n",
      "word \"dog\" inscribed on a child's forehead is a protection against the\r\n",
      "magic of foxes and badgers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some of the nostrums that are supposed to cure children's ailments are\r\n",
      "very curious. Blood extracted from a cock's comb cures indigestion,\r\n",
      "while an eruption on the head may be driven away by repeating these\r\n",
      "words: \"In the long days of spring weeds may be removed, but those\r\n",
      "in the garden must be cut down at once.\" Even a Japanese baby cries\r\n",
      "occasionally, but if a red bag containing dog's hair is fastened on its\r\n",
      "back, it will immediately cease to cry, and the plaintive wailing will\r\n",
      "give place to smiles. Blindness is frequently the result of smallpox,\r\n",
      "but this calamity may be prevented by throwing seven peas into a well,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The _Kappa_ is a river goblin, a hairy creature with the body of a\r\n",

      "in the top of which there is a cavity containing a mysterious fluid,\r\n",

      "unfortunate man who receives an invitation of this kind cannot refuse.\r\n",
      "Though the _Kappa_ is fierce and quarrelsome, he is, nevertheless,\r\n",
      "extremely polite. The wayfarer who receives his peremptory summons\r\n",
      "gives the goblin a profound bow. The courteous _Kappa_ acknowledges the\r\n",
      "obeisance, and in inclining his head the strength-giving liquid runs\r\n",
      "out from the hollow in his cranium, and becoming feeble, his warlike\r\n",
      "characteristics immediately disappear. To defeat the _Kappa_, however,\r\n",
      "is just as unfortunate as to receive a beating at his hands, for the\r\n",
      "momentary glory of the conquest is rapidly followed by a wasting away\r\n",
      "of the unfortunate wayfarer. The _Kappa_ possesses the propensities of\r\n",
      "a vampire, for he strikes people in the water, as they bathe in lake or\r\n",
      "river, and sucks their blood. In a certain part of Japan the _Kappa_ is\r\n",
      "said to claim two victims every year. When they emerge from the water\r\n",

      "a practice of seizing and destroying a number of villagers, and in\r\n",
      "addition many of their domestic animals. On one occasion a horse went\r\n",
      "into the river, and the _Kappa_, in trying to capture it, in some way\r\n",
      "twisted his neck, but in spite of considerable pain he refused to\r\n",
      "let his victim go. The frightened horse sprang up the river bank and\r\n",
      "ran into a neighbouring field with the Kappa still holding on to the\r\n",
      "terrified animal. The owner of the horse, together with many villagers,\r\n",
      "securely bound the Child of the River. \"Let us kill this horrible\r\n",
      "creature,\" said the peasants, \"for he has assuredly committed many\r\n",
      "horrible crimes, and we should do well to be rid of such a dreadful\r\n",

      "We will make him swear never to destroy any of the inhabitants or the\r\n",
      "domestic animals of this village.\" A document was accordingly prepared,\r\n",
      "and the _Kappa_ was asked to peruse it, and when he had done so to sign\r\n",
      "his name. \"I cannot write,\" replied the penitent _Kappa_, \"but I will\r\n",
      "dip my hand in ink and press it upon the document.\" When the creature\r\n",
      "had made his inky mark, he was released and allowed to return to the\r\n",

      "the _Tengu_ as \"a class of goblins or gnomes that haunt the mountains\r\n",
      "and woodlands, and play many pranks. They have an affinity to birds;\r\n",
      "for they are winged and beaked, sometimes clawed. But often the beak\r\n",
      "becomes a large and enormously long human nose, and the whole creature\r\n",
      "is conceived as human, nothing bird-like remaining but the fan of\r\n",
      "feathers with which it fans itself. It is often dressed in leaves,\r\n",
      "and wears on its head a tiny cap.\" In brief, the _Tengu_ are minor\r\n",
      "divinities, and are supreme in the art of fencing, and, indeed, in the\r\n",
      "use of weapons generally. The ideographs with which the name is written\r\n",
      "signify \"heavenly dog,\" which is misleading, for the creature bears\r\n",
      "no resemblance to a dog, and is, as we have already described, partly\r\n",
      "human and partly bird-like in appearance. There are other confusing\r\n",
      "traditions in regard to the word _Tengu_, for it is said that the\r\n",
      "Emperor Jomei gave the name to a certain meteor \"which whirled from\r\n",
      "east to west with a loud detonation.\" Then, again, a still more ancient\r\n",
      "belief informs us that the _Tengu_ were emanations from Susa-no-o, the\r\n",

      "beasts and great ears and noses of such enormous length that they could\r\n",
      "carry men on them and fly with their suspended burden for thousands\r\n",
      "of miles without fatigue, and in addition their teeth were so strong\r\n",
      "and so sharp that these female demons could bite through swords and\r\n",
      "spears. The _Tengu_ is still believed to inhabit certain forests and\r\n",
      "the recesses of high mountains. Generally speaking, the _Tengu_ is not\r\n",
      "a malevolent being, for he possesses a keen sense of humour, and is\r\n",
      "fond of a practical joke. Sometimes, however, the _Tengu_ mysteriously\r\n",
      "hides human beings, and when finally they return to their homes they\r\n",
      "do so in a demented condition. This strange occurrence is known as\r\n",

      "appearance of a _Tengu_, feathers, long nose, claws, and all. Having\r\n",
      "thus disguised himself he climbed up into a tree belonging to a sacred\r\n",

      "discovery than they also perceived Kiuchi's girdle, which had been cut\r\n",
      "into three pieces. At midnight, those who searched heard a strange cry,\r\n",
      "a voice calling for help. Suzuki Shichiro, one of the party, chanced\r\n",
      "to look up, and he saw a strange creature with wings standing upon the\r\n",
      "roof of a temple. When the rest of the band had joined their comrade,\r\n",
      "they all looked upon the weird figure, and one said: \"I believe it\r\n",
      "is nothing but an umbrella flapping in the wind.\" \"Let us make quite\r\n",
      "sure,\" replied Suzuki Shichiro, and with these words he lifted up his\r\n",

      "speedily as possible.\"\r\n",

      "was red, and his dishevelled hair fell upon the ground. 'Climb up on\r\n",
      "yonder roof,' he shouted fiercely. I refused to obey such an evil-faced\r\n",
      "villain, and drew my sword, but in a moment he bent the blade and broke\r\n",
      "my scabbard into fragments. Then my girdle was roughly torn off and\r\n",
      "cut into three pieces. When these things had been done, I was carried\r\n",
      "to a roof, and there severely chastised. But this was not the end of\r\n",
      "my trouble, for after I had been beaten, I was forced to seat myself\r\n",
      "on a round tray. In a moment I was whirled into the air, and the tray\r\n",
      "carried me with great speed to many regions. When it appeared to me\r\n",
      "that I had travelled through space for ten days, I prayed to the\r\n",
      "Lord Buddha, and found myself on what appeared to be the summit of a\r\n",

      "hand and began to drink, making a wry face as he did so. \"This is not\r\n",
      "_saké_!\" he exclaimed fiercely; \"it is filthy water,\" and having said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The red man thus made answer: \"You are evidently not aware that I am\r\n",

      "of the sudden appearance of Mount Fuji I came here to see it, assured\r\n",

      "met Koyuri, and had the good fortune to save his honest father's life\r\n",
      "by giving him some of our sacred white _saké_ that restores youth to\r\n",
      "human beings, together with an increase in years, while to _Shojō_ it\r\n",
      "vanquishes death. Koyuri's father is a good man, and the _saké_ was\r\n",
      "thus able to exert its full and beneficent power upon him; but you are\r\n",
      "greedy and selfish, and to all such this _saké_ is poison.\"\r\n",

      "delicious. He lost no time in making friends with Yurine, and some\r\n",
      "years later these men took up their abode on the southern side of Mount\r\n",

      "The Dragon\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Dragon is undoubtedly the most famous of mythical beasts, but,\r\n",
      "though Chinese in origin, it has become intimately associated with\r\n",
      "Japanese mythology. The creature lives for the most part in the ocean,\r\n",
      "river, or lake, but it has the power of flight and rules over clouds\r\n",
      "and tempests. The Dragon of China and Japan resemble each other,\r\n",
      "with the exception that the Japanese variety has three claws, while\r\n",
      "that of the Celestial Kingdom has five. The Chinese Emperor Yao was\r\n",
      "said to be the son of a dragon, and many rulers of that country were\r\n",
      "metaphorically referred to as \"dragon-faced.\" The Dragon has the head\r\n",
      "of a camel, horns of a deer, eyes of a hare, scales of a carp, paws of\r\n",
      "a tiger, and claws resembling those of an eagle. In addition it has\r\n",
      "whiskers, a bright jewel under its chin, and a measure on the top of\r\n",
      "its head which enables it to ascend to Heaven at will. This is merely\r\n",
      "a general description and does not apply to all dragons, some of which\r\n",
      "have heads of so extraordinary a kind that they cannot be compared with\r\n",
      "anything in the animal kingdom. The breath of the Dragon changes into\r\n",
      "clouds from which come either rain or fire. It is able to expand or\r\n",
      "contract its body, and in addition it has the power of transformation\r\n",
      "and invisibility. In both Chinese and Japanese mythology the watery\r\n",
      "principle is associated with the Dragon, as we have already seen in the\r\n",

      "the Mansions of the Gods, the Spiritual Dragon presided over rain, the\r\n",

      "spirits) sprang upon them. Issunboshi took out his needle-sword from\r\n",
      "its hollow straw, and loudly denouncing the _oni_, he flourished his\r\n",
      "small weapon in their evil-looking faces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the creatures laughed. \"Why,\" said he scornfully, \"I could\r\n",

      "funny little bean-seed, I will do so!\"\r\n",

      "which sent the little fellow into the sunny world again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second _oni_, who had witnessed his companion's distress, was\r\n",
      "extremely angry, and tried to swallow the remarkable little page, but\r\n",

      "hare and a monkey wrestled together, while a deer stood by to give\r\n",
      "encouragement and to see that the sport was conducted fairly. Both\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Kato Sayemon lived in the palace of the Shōgun Ashikaga, where he had\r\n",
      "his separate apartments, and as there was no war at that time, he\r\n",
      "remained contentedly with his wife and concubines. Kato Sayemon was a\r\n",
      "man who loved luxury and ease, and he regarded domestic peace as the\r\n",
      "greatest of all earthly blessings. He honestly believed that among all\r\n",
      "his smiling, courteous women there was nothing but harmony, and this\r\n",
      "thought made life particularly sweet to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening Kato Sayemon went into the palace garden and was enchanted\r\n",
      "by the ever-moving cloud of fireflies, and he was scarcely less pleased\r\n",
      "with the gentle song of certain insects. \"What a charming scene,\"\r\n",
      "murmured Sayemon, \"and what a charming world we live in! Bows and\r\n",
      "smiles and abject humility from my women. Oh, it's all very wonderful\r\n",
      "and very delightful! I would have life always so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus voicing his thoughts in this self-satisfied manner, he chanced to\r\n",
      "pass his wife's room, and peeped in with a loving and benevolent eye.\r\n",
      "He observed that his wife was playing _go_ with one of his concubines.\r\n",
      "\"Such polite decorum,\" murmured Sayemon. \"Surely their words are as\r\n",
      "sweet as honey and as soft and fair as finely spun silk. But stay! What\r\n",
      "strange thing is this? The hair of my wife and the hair of my concubine\r\n",
      "have turned into snakes that twist and rear their heads in anger.\r\n",
      "All the time these women smile and bow and move their pieces with\r\n",
      "well-ordered charm and grace. Gentle words come from their lips, but\r\n",
      "the snakes of their hair mock them, for these twisting reptiles tell\r\n",
      "of bitter jealousy in their hearts.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sayemon's beautiful dream of domestic happiness was for ever shattered.\r\n",
      "\"I will go forth,\" said he, \"and become a Buddhist priest. I will leave\r\n",
      "behind the hot malice and envy of my wife and concubines, and in the\r\n",
      "teaching of the Blessed One I shall indeed find true peace.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next morning Sayemon left the palace secretly, and though search\r\n",
      "was made for him, he could not be found. About a week later Sayemon's\r\n",
      "wife reduced the establishment and lived quietly with her little son,\r\n",
      "Ishidomaro. Two years went by and still there came no news of her\r\n",
      "husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length Sayemon's wife and child went in search of the missing man.\r\n",
      "For five years they wandered about the country, till at length they\r\n",
      "came to a little village in Kishu, where an old man informed the weary\r\n",
      "and travel-stained wanderers that Sayemon was now a priest, and that a\r\n",
      "year ago he lived in the temple of Kongobuji, on Mount Koya.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next day the woman and her son found that at the temple of\r\n",
      "Kongobuji no women were permitted to enter, so Ishidomaro, after\r\n",
      "carefully listening to his mother's instructions, ascended the mountain\r\n",
      "alone. When the boy, after a long and arduous climb, reached the\r\n",
      "temple, he saw a monk, and said: \"Does a priest called Kato Sayemon\r\n",
      "live here? I am his little son, and my good mother awaits me in yonder\r\n",
      "valley. Five years we have sought for him, and the love that is in our\r\n",
      "hearts will surely find him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The priest, who was none other than Sayemon himself, thus addressed his\r\n",
      "son: \"I am sorry to think that your journey has been in vain, for no\r\n",
      "one of the name of Kato Sayemon lives in this temple.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sayemon spoke with outward coldness, but within his heart there was a\r\n",
      "struggle between his religion and love for his son. Knowing, however,\r\n",
      "that he had left his wife and child well provided for, he yielded to\r\n",
      "the teaching of the Lord Buddha and crushed out his parental feelings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ishidomaro, however, was not satisfied, for he felt instinctively\r\n",
      "that the man before him was in reality his father, and once again he\r\n",
      "addressed the priest: \"Good sir, on my left eye there is a mole, and\r\n",
      "my mother told me that on the left eye of my father there is a similar\r\n",
      "mark, by which I might at once recognise him. You have the very mark,\r\n",
      "and in my heart I know that you are my father.\" And having said these\r\n",
      "words the boy wept bitterly, longing for arms that never came to caress\r\n",
      "and soothe the unhappy little fellow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sayemon's feelings were again stirred; but with a great effort to\r\n",
      "conceal his emotion, he said: \"The mark of which you speak is very\r\n",
      "common. I am certainly not your father, and you had better dry your\r\n",
      "eyes and seek him elsewhere.\" With these words the priest left the boy\r\n",
      "in order to attend an evening service.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sayemon continued to live in the temple. He had found peace in serving\r\n",
      "the Lord Buddha, and he cared not what became of his wife and child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How an Old Man lost his Wen\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was once an old man who had a wen on his right cheek. This\r\n",
      "disfigurement caused him a good deal of annoyance, and he had spent a\r\n",
      "considerable sum of money in trying to get rid of it. He took various\r\n",
      "medicines and applied many lotions, but instead of the wen disappearing\r\n",
      "or even diminishing, it increased in size.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One night, while the old man was returning home laden with firewood,\r\n",
      "he was overtaken by a terrible thunderstorm, and was forced to seek\r\n",
      "shelter in a hollow tree. When the storm had abated, and just as\r\n",
      "he was about to proceed on his journey, he was surprised to hear a\r\n",
      "sound of merriment close at hand. On peeping out from his place of\r\n",
      "retreat, he was amazed to see a number of demons dancing and singing\r\n",
      "and drinking. Their dancing was so strange that the old man, forgetting\r\n",
      "caution, began to laugh, and eventually left the tree in order that he\r\n",
      "might see the performance better. As he stood watching, he saw that\r\n",
      "a demon was dancing by himself, and, moreover, that the chief of the\r\n",
      "company was none too pleased with his very clumsy antics. At length\r\n",
      "the leader of the demons said: \"Enough! Is there no one who can dance\r\n",
      "better than this fellow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the old man heard these words, it seemed that his youth returned\r\n",
      "to him again, and having at one time been an expert dancer, he offered\r\n",
      "to show his skill. So the old man danced before that strange gathering\r\n",
      "of demons, who congratulated him on his performance, offered him a cup\r\n",
      "of _saké_, and begged that he would give them the pleasure of several\r\n",
      "other dances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man was extremely gratified by the way he had been received,\r\n",
      "and when the chief of the demons asked him to dance before them on the\r\n",
      "following night, he readily complied. \"That is well,\" said the chief,\r\n",
      "\"but you must leave some pledge behind you. I see that you have a wen\r\n",
      "on your right cheek, and that will make an excellent pledge. Allow me\r\n",
      "to take it off for you.\" Without inflicting any pain, the chief removed\r\n",
      "the wen, and having accomplished this extraordinary feat, he and his\r\n",
      "companions suddenly vanished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old man, as he walked towards his home, kept on feeling his right\r\n",
      "cheek with his hand, and could scarcely realise that after many\r\n",
      "years of disfigurement he had at last the good fortune to lose his\r\n",
      "troublesome and unsightly wen. At length he entered his humble abode,\r\n",
      "and his old wife was none the less pleased with what had taken place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A wicked and cantankerous old man lived next door to this good old\r\n",
      "couple. For many years he had been afflicted with a wen on his left\r\n",
      "cheek, which had failed to yield to all manner of medical treatment.\r\n",
      "When he heard of his neighbour's good fortune, he called upon him and\r\n",
      "listened to the strange adventures with the demons. The good old man\r\n",
      "told his neighbour where he might find the hollow tree, and advised him\r\n",
      "to hide in it just before sunset.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The wicked old man found the hollow tree and entered it. He had not\r\n",
      "remained concealed more than a few minutes when he rejoiced to see the\r\n",
      "demons. Presently one of the company said: \"The old man is a long time\r\n",
      "coming. I made sure he would keep his promise.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At these words the old man crept out of his hiding-place, flourished\r\n",
      "his fan, and began to dance; but, unfortunately, he knew nothing about\r\n",
      "dancing, and his extraordinary antics caused the demons to express\r\n",
      "considerable dissatisfaction. \"You dance extremely ill,\" said one of\r\n",
      "the company, \"and the sooner you stop the better we shall be pleased;\r\n",
      "but before you depart we will return the pledge you left with us last\r\n",
      "night.\" Having uttered these words, the demon flung the wen at the\r\n",
      "right cheek of the old man, where it remained firmly fixed, and could\r\n",
      "not be removed. So the wicked old man, who had tried to deceive the\r\n",
      "demons, went away with a wen on either side of his face.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Shikaiya Wasōbiōye was a man of Nagasaki, and possessed considerable\r\n",
      "learning, but disliked visitors. On the eighth day of the eighth\r\n",
      "month, in order to escape the admirers of the full moon, he set off\r\n",
      "in his boat, and had proceeded some distance, when the sky looked\r\n",
      "threatening, and he attempted to return, but the wind tore his sail\r\n",
      "and broke his mast. The poor man was tossed for three months on the\r\n",
      "waves, until at last he came to the Sea of Mud, where he nearly died of\r\n",
      "hunger, for there were no fishes to be caught.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length he reached a mountainous island, where the air was sweet with\r\n",
      "the fragrance of many flowers, and in this island he found a spring,\r\n",
      "the waters of which revived him. At length Wasōbiōye met Jofuku, who\r\n",
      "led him through the streets of the main city, where all the inhabitants\r\n",
      "were spending their time in pursuit of pleasure. There was no death\r\n",
      "or disease on this island; but the fact that here life was eternal\r\n",
      "was regarded by many as a burden, which they tried to shake off by\r\n",
      "studying the magic art of death and the power of poisonous food, such\r\n",
      "as globe-fish sprinkled with soot and the flesh of mermaids.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When twenty years had passed by Wasōbiōye grew weary of the island, and\r\n",
      "as he had failed in his attempts to take his life, he started upon a\r\n",
      "journey to the Three Thousand Worlds mentioned in Buddhist Scriptures.\r\n",
      "He then visited the Land of Endless Plenty, the Land of Shams, the Land\r\n",
      "of the Followers of the Antique, the Land of Paradoxes, and, finally,\r\n",
      "the Land of Giants.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After Wasōbiōye had spent five months riding on the back of a stork\r\n",
      "through total darkness, he at length reached a country where the sun\r\n",
      "shone again, where trees were hundreds of feet in girth, where weeds\r\n",
      "were as large as bamboos, and men sixty feet in height. In this strange\r\n",
      "land a giant picked up Wasōbiōye, took him to his house, and fed him\r\n",
      "from a single grain of monster rice, with chopsticks the size of a\r\n",
      "small tree. For a few weeks Wasōbiōye attempted to catechise his host\r\n",
      "in regard to the doctrines of the old world whence he came, but the\r\n",
      "giant laughed at him and told him that such a small man could not be\r\n",

      "One day, while Tōtarō was crossing the Long Bridge of Séta, he saw a\r\n",
      "strange-looking creature. It had the body of a man, with a skin blacker\r\n",
      "than that of a negro; its eyes glowed like emeralds, and its beard was\r\n",
      "like the beard of a dragon. Tōtarō was not a little startled at seeing\r\n",
      "such an extraordinary being; but there was so much pathos in its green\r\n",
      "eyes that Tōtarō ventured to ask questions, to which the strange fellow\r\n",
      "replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am Samébito [\"A Shark-Person\"], and quite recently I was in the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Tōtarō's heart was touched by Samébito's humility, and he took him to a\r\n",

      "Tōtarō attended the festival, and there saw an extremely charming girl.\r\n",
      "\"Her face was fair and pure as snow; and the loveliness of her lips\r\n",
      "assured the beholder that their very utterance would sound 'as sweet\r\n",
      "as the voice of a nightingale singing upon a plum-tree.'\"\r\n",

      "when I am gone?\" said he mournfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Samébito saw that his good master was dying, he uttered a strange\r\n",

      "When Tōtarō saw these jewel-tears he shouted for joy, and new life came\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "So Tōtarō told the Shark-Man of his love-affair and of the\r\n",

      "well to practise a form that engenders suppression and delicately\r\n",
      "gives suggestion the supreme place. It is surprising what music and\r\n",
      "sentiment are expressed within these limits. The _tanka_ is certainly\r\n",
      "brief in form, but it frequently suggests, with haunting insistency,\r\n",
      "that the fragment really has no end, when imagination seizes it and\r\n",
      "turns it into a thousand thousand lines. The _tanka_ belongs as much\r\n",
      "to Japan as Mount Fuji itself. One cannot regard it without thinking\r\n",
      "that a Japanese poet must essentially have all the finer instincts of\r\n",
      "an artist. In him the two arts seem inseparable. He must convey in\r\n",
      "five lines, in the most felicitous language at his disposal, the idea\r\n",
      "he wishes to express. That he does so with extraordinary success is\r\n",
      "beyond dispute. These brief poems are wonderfully characteristic of\r\n",
      "the Japanese people, for they have such a love for little things. The\r\n",
