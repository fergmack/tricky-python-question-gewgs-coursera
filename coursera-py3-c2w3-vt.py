//** Really Pointless Qusetion Below - Just use a for loop **
Write a function, sublist, that takes in a list of numbers as the parameter. In the function, use a while loop to return a sublist of the input list. The sublist should contain the same values of the original list up until it reaches the number 5 (it should not contain the number 5).
