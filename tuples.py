# As we mentioned earlier, strings and lists are both examples of sequences. Strings are sequences of characters, and are immutable. Lists are sequences of elements of any data type, and are mutable. The third sequence type is the tuple. Tuples are like lists, since they can contain elements of any data type. But unlike lists, tuples are immutable. They’re specified using parentheses instead of square brackets.

# You might be wondering why tuples are a thing, given how similar they are to lists. Tuples can be useful when we need to ensure that an element is in a certain position and will not change. Since lists are mutable, the order of the elements can be changed on us. Since the order of the elements in a tuple can't be changed, the position of the element in a tuple can have meaning. A good example of this is when a function returns multiple values. In this case, what gets returned is a tuple, with the return values as elements in the tuple. The order of the returned values is important, and a tuple ensures that the order isn’t going to change. Storing the elements of a tuple in separate variables is called unpacking. This allows you to take multiple returned values from a function and store each value in its own variable

# Coursersa:
# If you remember, the .items() dictionary method produces a sequence of tuples. Keeping this in mind, we have provided you a dictionary called pokemon. For every key value pair, append the key to the list p_names, and append the value to the list p_number. Do not use the .keys() or .values() methods.


pokemon = {'Rattata': 19, 'Machop': 66, 'Seel': 86, 'Volbeat': 86, 'Solrock': 126}
p_names =[]
p_number =[]

for k, v in pokemon.items():
    p_names.append(k)
    p_number.append(v)
    
    
# The .items() method produces a sequence of key-value pair tuples. With this in mind, write code to create a list of keys from the dictionary track_medal_counts and assign the list to the variable name track_events. Do NOT use the .keys() method.

track_medal_counts = {'shot put': 1, 'long jump': 3, '100 meters': 2, '400 meters': 2, '100 meter hurdles': 3, 'triple jump': 3, 'steeplechase': 2, '1500 meters': 1, '5K': 0, '10K': 0, 'marathon': 0, '200 meters': 0, '400 meter hurdles': 0, 'high jump': 1}

track_events = []
for i in track_medal_counts.items():
    track_events.append(i[0])
